      plan and session format of this Steps by the Big Book group course. Consider
      that each member is expected to not only talk about but to do each of the Steps
      and, if possible, to attend every session with the team.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This

      about our daily activities, we think about the people, places, and things that
      are unmanageable, or over which we are powerless. Each day we write: &ldquo;I

      by Dr. Silkworth in the Doctor&rsquo;s Opinion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;
      1.) &nbsp; The mental obsession (xxviii: 4)&nbsp; [(L obsession- siege) preoccupation,
      fixed idea]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 2.) &nbsp; The physical compulsion [physical
      <em>craving </em>or <em>allergy</em> (xxx: 0), compelled to act]&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;

      (59: 2)]</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>How am I affected by Dr. Silkworth&rsquo;s definition
      of alcoholism as a medical problem? (xxx: 0) [Disease: (L- To lack ease.) Involuntary
      disability. See 64: 3]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did I drink <em>essentially because </em>[I]<em>
      like the effect produced by alcohol</em>? (xxviii: 4)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Have
      I been <em>restless, irritable, and discontented</em>? (xxviii: 4)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Have
      I sought <em>the sense of ease and comfort which comes at once by taking a few
      drinks</em>? (xxix: 0)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Describe in detail how I succumbed
      <em>to the desire again</em>? (xxix: 0)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In what ways did
      I reach the point where I could not differentiate <em>the true from the false</em>?&nbsp;
      (xxviii: 4)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When did I first experience an abnormal mental obsession
      with alcohol? Describe. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2.)
      &nbsp; Physical Compulsion&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[Body:&nbsp; <em>powerless</em>&nbsp;
      (59: 2)]</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>How did I develop the <em>physical&hellip;phenomenon
      of craving </em>[<em>allergy</em>]? (xxvii: 7 -xxviii: 0,1; xxix: 0, 4; xxx:
      1, 5)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How do I describe my pathological physical reaction to alcohol?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In
      what ways has my alcoholic body become as sick as my alcoholic mind? (xxvi:
      2)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is my understanding of the concept of alcoholism as the
      <em>manifestation of an allergy</em>? (xxviii: 1)&nbsp; [Allergy (Gr allos &ndash;
      strange): An abnormal reaction.]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How do I feel about the idea
      of hospitalization? (xxvi: 4; xxviii: 0)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When did I first experience
      a physical compulsion or craving for alcohol? Describe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3.)
      &nbsp; Drinking to Excess:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In what ways did I <em>pass
      through the well-known stages of a spree, emerging remorseful, with a firm resolution
      not to drink again</em>? (xxix: 0)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In what ways did I repeat this
      <em>over and over</em>? (xxix: 0)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What are my reflections on the
      ideas that alcoholism <em>has never been&hellip;permanently eradicated</em>;
      and that <em>the only relief&hellip;is entire abstinence</em>? (xxx: 5)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When
      did I first experience the loss of control of my drinking? Describe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4.)
      &nbsp; Psychic Change</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is my understanding of a <em>psychic
      change</em>? (xxix: 1, 3)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is meant by being <em>required
      to follow a few simple rules</em>? (xxix: 1)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Am I aware that,
      if I have been abstinent from alcohol a while, Step 1 is about my powerlessness
      over some other behavior or thought-habit that reflects the unmanageability
      of my life and mind?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Am I aware that I need to find a way to stop
      that behavior so that my surrender is not blocked by continued acting out?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What
      is of significance to me in this chapter?&nbsp; What do I not agree with?</p>\r\n"

      </strong>Read in the Big Book how in 1934 one of AA&#39;s founders, Bill W.,
      learned of the problem, the solution, and the program of action to recover from
      alcoholism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. The <strong>Problem</strong>: From Dr. Silkworth,
      Bill learned of the medical problem of alcoholism as both a mental and a physical
      illness. (7:1; xxv-xxxii)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. The <strong>Solution</strong>: From
      Dr. Carl Jung, (through Roland H. and Ebby T.) Bill learned of the spiritual
      solution to the problem as a <em>necessary vital spiritual experience</em>.
      (27: 5; see also 9: 6; 567-8)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. The <strong>Program of Action</strong>:
      From the Oxford Group (through Ebby T.), Bill learned of the discipline of practicing
      a step by step program of principles and action that opens one to the necessary
      <em>vital spiritual experiences.</em>&nbsp; (27: 4) [See also He Sold Himself

      review selections from Bill&#39;s Story together.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We each
      consider sharing our own writings and personal Step 1 stories with the group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rather

      did Bill mean by, <em>I commenced to forge the weapon&hellip;that one day would
      turn&hellip;like a boomerang and&hellip;cut me to ribbons</em>? (2: 2)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Was
      there a time for me when <em>liquor ceased to be a luxury; it became a necessity</em>?

      does an <em>appalling lack of perspective&nbsp;</em> relate to sanity, honesty,
      or humility? (5: 5)&nbsp; What do sanity, honesty, and humility mean to me?
      [Optional: <em>12&amp;12</em> pp, 48: 0; 58: 1; 72: 2]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In what
      specific ways did I feel <em>the remorse, horror and hopelessness of the next
      morning</em>? (6: 1)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did I ask, <em>Should I kill myself</em>?
      (6: 1)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;In what ways did I seek <em>oblivion</em>? (6: 1)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;In
      what ways have I felt fear? (6: 2, 7: 0)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What are my reflections
      on Dr. Silkworth&#39;s proposition that we have been <em>seriously ill, bodily
      and mentally</em>? (7: 1)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did I see that <em>I could not take
      so much as one drink</em>? (5: 4) &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did such <em>self-knowledge</em>
      (7: 2) of the problem of <em>the insanity of that first drink </em>(8: 2) alone
      keep me sober?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bill describes taking Step 1 by admitting,
      <em>Alcohol was my master</em>. (8: 1)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In what ways has alcohol
      been my master? (8: 1)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2.) &nbsp;
      The <em>Solution</em> (17: 3)&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is my understanding
      of the <em>simple religious idea</em>? (9: 6)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What was my reaction
      to&rsquo; religion&rsquo;, &lsquo;the church&rsquo;, and &lsquo;God&rsquo;?
      (10: 1)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How do I react to the suggestion, <em>Why don&rsquo;t
      you choose your own conception of God?</em> (12: 2; 46: 2)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bill
      takes Step 2 when he understands that, <em>nothing more was required...to make
      my beginning</em> than <em>being willing</em> <em>to believe</em>. (12: 4)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note
      that Bill was instructed <em>to sit quietly</em> and <em>to</em> <em>test </em>[his]<em>
      thinking by the new God-consciousness within</em>. (13: 4)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3.)

      is my understanding of the <em>practical program of action</em>? (9: 6)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How
      did this derive from the non-alcoholic <em>Oxford Groups of that day</em>? (

      the <em>revolutionary and drastic proposals</em>? (14: 2)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note
      that Bill essentially takes Step 3 through Step 12 at this time while still
      in the hospital. [Step 1 (8: 1); Step 2 (12: 4); Steps 3-11 (13: 2-4); Step

      is one who loses <em>all control of his liquor consumption once he begins to
      drink</em>? (21: 1)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Am I a <em>real alcoholic</em>? (21:

      think we needed to be so much in control.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Points
      of Focus and Reflection&nbsp; </strong>(Consider pp. 44: 1,3; 45: 1,2,3; 47:
      1; 52: 1,2,3; 567-8)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.) &nbsp; Am I willing?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Can
      I believe that other alcoholics have found peace of mind through this process?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What
      is it, precisely and in detail, that I have worshipped? (54: 1)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What,
      exactly, have I experienced? (55: 2-3)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Am I willing to consider
      that I am not at the core of everything &ndash; good or bad &ndash; and hence
      there may be a power greater than any one of us?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Was I insane
      or crazy to believe the lies the alcohol told me?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2.)
      &nbsp; My Problem</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What do these definitions of alcoholism
      mean to me?:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; -<em> when you honestly want to</em>,
      <em>you find you cannot quit</em> <em>entirely</em>&nbsp; [Mind]<em> &nbsp;
      &nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; - <em>when drinking, you have little
      control over the amount you take.</em> [Body]<em> &nbsp; </em>(44: 1)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If
      being <em>crazy</em> or <em>insanity</em> is a loss of <em>perspective</em>
      and <em>proportion</em> (5: 5; 37: 1), how is this like denial, dishonesty,
      or lack of humility? [<em>12&amp;12</em> pp. 48: 0; 58: 1; 72: 2]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In
      what areas of my life do I need sanity now?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In what ways am I
      addicted to my painful and insane ways of thinking and reacting?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3.)
      &nbsp; My Solution</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>How do I react when the authors tell
      me that <em>we must find a spiritual basis in life &ndash; or else</em>? (44:
      3) <strong>&nbsp; </strong>In what ways am I spiritual?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What does
      this mean to me:&nbsp; the Big Book&rsquo;s <em>main object</em> <em>is to enable
      you to find a Power greater than yourself which will solve your problem</em>?
      (45: 2)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4.) &nbsp; My Own Conception
      of a Higher Power</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>What do the
      terms<em> &lsquo;</em>agnostic,&rsquo; &lsquo;we came to believe&rsquo; and
      &lsquo;restore us to sanity&rsquo; mean to me? (See 55: 1-4,&nbsp; 57: 0)<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>How
      does my childhood training about God affect my life and recovery today? (45:
      3)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What does it mean when the authors of the Big Book say, <em>When,
      therefore, we speak to you of God, we mean your own conception of God</em>?
      <em>This applies, too, to other spiritual expressions</em>&hellip;. <em>What</em>
      [do] <em>they mean to you</em>? (47: 1)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What does <em>work</em>
      mean, as in, <em>Is not our age characterized by the ease with which we discard
      old ideas for new,&hellip;throw away the theory or gadget which does not </em><em>work</em><em>
      for something new which does</em>? (52: 1)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What works and does
      not work in my life to give me serenity and peace of mind?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For
      me, how is it that, <em>Our ideas did not </em><em>work</em><em>. But the God
      idea did</em>? (52: 3)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>III
      &nbsp; &nbsp; DAILY PRACTICE OF STEP 2 PRINCIPLES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>How
      may I practice my new belief that I can get well or more well?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How
      may I know that help is available, that I am not entirely alone?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How
      may I stop relying on my own thinking and begin to ask for help today?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How
      may I be <em>willing to grow along spiritual lines</em>? (60: 1)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Have
      I sought help from my sponsor, gone to meetings, and reached out to other recovering
      alcoholics? What were the results?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>May I find a sign of
      a higher power in the support I receive from the fellowship?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*

      then according to the Big Book and under the conditions of this day, we take
      Step 2.&nbsp; Keep in mind that our reasonable best is always more than good

      &nbsp; </strong>(Consider pp. 60: 3-63: 3)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; 1.) &nbsp; The Problem of Self</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a.) &nbsp; <em>Each person is like an actor who
      wants to run the whole show</em></strong><em>.</em> (60: 4)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Our
      actor is self-centered &hellip; Are not most of us concerned with our resentments,
      our self-pity, or ourselves?</em> (61: 2-62: 0)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How am I like
      an actor? (60: 4)&nbsp; What roles, what masks, what characters do I play? Are
      these old worn out defenses? [See 73: 1; Optional <em>12&amp;12</em>, 57: 1]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Am
      I <em>almost always in collision with something or some body</em>? (60: 4)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &nbsp; b.)<em> &nbsp; The show doesn&rsquo;t come off</em></strong>. (61: 1)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where
      do I think that life does not treat me right? (61: 1)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where
      do my actions make the other players wish to retaliate and snatch all they can
      get out of the show? (61: 1)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In my own life, am I familiar with
      the progression: anger =&gt; indignation =&gt; self-pity? (61: 1)&nbsp; Describe
      in detail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In what ways does the following describe me? <em>Is
      he not a victim of the delusion that he can wrest satisfaction and happiness
      out of this world if he only manages well?</em> (61: 1) [Is this the essence
      of Step 1?] -What do <em>delusion</em> (30: 2; 61: 1), <em>denial</em> (10:
      1), and <em>manages</em> (61: 1) mean to me?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &nbsp; c.)<em> &nbsp; So our troubles, we think, are basically of our own making</em></strong>.
      (62: 2)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What does this mean?&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t alcohol
      and other people cause all my troubles?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How do my reactions to
      life events make me suffer?&nbsp; Be specific. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Driven
      by a hundred forms of fear, self-delusion, self-seeking, and self-pity, we step
      on the toes of our fellows and they retaliate</em>. (62: 1)&nbsp; Is this so?&nbsp;
      How?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where in the past have I made decisions based on self that
      later placed me in a position to be hurt? (62: 1)&nbsp; Be specific and give
      details. [See what self-instincts can be threatened, and that we react to, in
      the Step 4 <em>Affects My</em> column (65: 2)]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2.)&nbsp;

      has my playing God worked, or not worked, to give me and others serenity?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>We
      had to quit playing God. It didn&rsquo;t work</em>. (62: 3)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When
      did I stop playing God?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3.) The Program
      of Action</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Can I make a decision to turn my life and will
      over to a higher power of my understanding, just for today?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In
      what ways am I taking action on Step 3 when I abstain from alcohol and work
      the remaining Steps?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step 3 Promises:<strong> </strong>&nbsp;
      Is it possible that I could enjoy <em>peace of mind</em>, <em>face life successfully</em>,

      does Step 3 allow me to build on the surrender I have developed in Step 1 and
      Step 2?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Am I fighting anything in recovery? What do I think would
      happen if I became willing to let recovery prevail in that area of my life?
      &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How may I reaffirm my decision on a daily basis and continue
      to take the action of working the rest of the Steps?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How may I

      of a written inventory beyond an assets/liabilities checklist. Watch for paralysis
      from fear/perfectionism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We come here with a huge load of stored
      up shame, guilt, and unresolved pain to be let go of. Step 4 helps us lay bare
      the conflicts of the past so that we are no longer at their mercy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step
      4 gives us the means to find out who we are, and what we are not. It is about
      finding our assets as well as our defects of character. We discover that our
      problems began long before we took our first drink. We may have felt isolated
      and afraid, and it was our desire to change the way we felt that led to our
      drinking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have a disease. We are not responsible for being
      an alcoholic, any more than a diabetic is responsible for being diabetic. But
      now that we know we are an alcoholic, we are responsible for our recovery. There
      are no longer excuses, because we realize we must live the principles of the
      Steps daily or we will die spiritually, emotionally and physically.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We
      are working on practices &ndash; things we do &ndash; that we will use every
      day of our lives to move us from being restless, irritable and discontented

      hurt or threatened </em>(65: 0), or where you had expectations of others, or
      others had expectations of you &ndash; where you were <em>sore</em> or were

      from the First Column of our grudge list that our anger and resentment at <strong>who</strong>
      hurt us (or did not meet our expectations) really does hold our mind hostage
      and controls us, and blocks us from the spirit of our understanding.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We
      learned from the Second Column that it is not who the people, institutions,
      or principles are that make us angry and resentful; it is <strong>how</strong>
      they hurt or threatened us. It is not so much who they are but how they ACT.
      Just like us, they may be good people who do foolish things. We may begin forgiving
      ourselves for our own actions and behaviors, and others for their actions, right
      here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We learned from the Third Column that it is not who or even
      how they hurt us, but the way we have habitually chosen to REACT to <strong>what</strong>
      they threaten in us which determines whether we are upset or not.&nbsp; <strong>We
      react by habit</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2<sup>ND</sup>&nbsp;

      (65: 3)&nbsp; <strong>Why</strong><strong>?</strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Why
      must I change?&rdquo; Our present mental resentment habits lead to self pity,
      are a waste of time and, if we do not change, we may drink and die.&nbsp; Our
      own thought-habits lead us to drink.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now we know why we must change.

      <em>motives</em> (86: 2) were the terms used by early AA&rsquo;s as mirror-images
      of the &ldquo;Four Absolutes&rdquo; of the Oxford Group: &ldquo;Absolute Selflessness,&rdquo;
      &ldquo;Absolute Honesty,&rdquo; &ldquo;Absolute Purity,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Absolute
      Love.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In contrast, since the Big Book authors were
      afraid of getting drunk trying for perfection, and to be absolutely too good
      too soon, they tried rather to be less selfish, less dishonest, less self-seeking,
      and less fearful. Consequently they found they were less likely to take a drink
      and less likely to live on an emotional dry bender.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Opposite
      each Third Column instinct or role that was threatened and that you reacted
      to, write down and share precisely and in detail what your motives were.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Try
      to keep your written responses concise with specific examples. Avoid generalities.
      Expand upon &quot;I lied,&quot; or &quot;I was dishonest,&quot; by telling what
      happened; for example: &quot;I promised to be there and never showed up.&quot;</p>\r\n"

    - "<p><strong>Motives defined</strong><strong>:</strong>&nbsp; What do these terms
      mean to you? (see 47: 1)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>a.)&nbsp;
      Selfishness</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Concern for self regardless of others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Selfishness:
      ego = me.&nbsp; Self-absorption: &quot;It&#39;s all about me!&quot; Regard for
      our own interest or happiness to the disregard of the well-being of others.
      Not aware of others and their needs. Instinctively putting our own needs first.
      A false sense of a separate self, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Habitual selfishness: We
      could not see others&rsquo; or our real place in the universe. [Optional: <em>Our
      total inability to form a true partnership with another human being. 12&amp;12</em>,
      53: 1]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&lsquo;Turnaround&rsquo;: We begin to see that we can change
      to our true nature &ndash; so that ultimately the best care of ourselves lies
      in our unselfish regard for the concern of the whole, that care for others includes
      us as well. Care of our selves becomes care of our soul, and is known to be
      care of all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>b.) &nbsp; Dishonesty
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>A tendency to deceit, to conceal our true character.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dishonest:
      Fraudulent, not what purported. The reverse of honesty; lack of probity or integrity;
      disposition to deceive, defraud, or steal; thievishness; theft, fraud. Not corresponding
      to fact. Trying to be people pleasers in order to gain approval from other people.
      Believing the lies our mind tells us, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Habitual dishonesty:
      We lost perspective. We often did not even know we were lying because we had
      a false way of seeing reality. D-E-N-I-A-L</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&lsquo;Turnaround&rsquo;:
      We begin to see that we can change to our true nature &ndash; to be who we truly
      are, free from concealment, to be a sincere person acting in direct, frank,
      open ways. We are good and caring people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &nbsp;c.) &nbsp; Self-seeking, inconsiderate&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; </strong>Concern
      for self over (or under) others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Self-seeking: The seeking after
      our own welfare before that of others, prosecution of selfish ends. To put ourselves
      either above or below others. Seeing ourselves as better or worse than others.
      Lacking perspective, etc</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inconsiderate: Thoughtless, negligent,
      rash, incautious, heedless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Habitual self-seeking: As a matter
      of course we tended to put our needs first, including our needs to be first,
      to be last, to be liked, to be feared, and to be pitied. [<em>Top of the heap,
      or to hide underneath it. 12&amp;12</em>, 53: 1]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&lsquo;Turnaround&rsquo;:
      We begin to see that we can change from self-seeking to our true nature &ndash;
      to be thoughtful and considerate and in partnership with others and to act with
      loving compassion toward ourselves and others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>d.)
      &nbsp; Fear &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>Dread. <em>Self-reliance failed us</em>.
      (68: 1)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fear: To feel alarmed or uneasy. The emotion of pain or
      uneasiness caused by the sense of impending danger. Apprehension of some future
      evil. [<em>Fear that we would lose something we already possessed or would fail
      to get something we wanted. 12&amp;12</em>, 76: 2], or be found out for who
      we are. To lose heart, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Habitual fear: Always anticipating
      ambush. Our apprehension of impending danger, our anxiety, was the existential
      basis for our selfishness, our dishonesty and self-seeking, and our drinking.</p>\r\n"

      everyone and everything else involved, look at each angry reaction situation
      and see what, if anything, we did to cause each event, or to make it worse,
      or to react to it and hence create more troubles for ourselves or others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>We

      &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>2.) &nbsp; Turnarounds</strong> &nbsp; In order to save
      our own lives, we are turning from our habitual point of view. <em>We stood
      at the turning point</em>. (59: 1)&nbsp; <em>Ideas, emotions, and attitudes
      which were once the guiding forces of the lives of these men are suddenly cast
      to one side, and a completely new set of conceptions and motives begin to dominate

      our thinking so a power greater than any one of us can direct our thinking instead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our

      (27: 4) that we developed in reaction to ancient <em>fancied or real</em> (66:

      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; WRITE YOUR OWN!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I read Step
      4, pp. 64-71 in <em>Alcoholics Anonymous</em> to examine three of my blocks
      to my higher power:&nbsp; resentment, fear, and the harms done in my relationships
      / sex conduct. I list my assets too. <em>We set them on paper</em>. (64: 3)
      I begin and end writing times with meditation / prayer. With practice, this
      inventory method takes me but a moment. My reasonable best is good enough.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;
      &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.) &nbsp; &nbsp; 1<sup>ST</sup>
      &nbsp; Working of Grudge List (64: 3-65: 2)</strong>:&nbsp; <strong>WHO-HOW-WHAT?</strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A.
      First Column: </strong><strong>WHO</strong><strong>?</strong>&nbsp; &ldquo;Who
      hurt or threatened me?&rdquo; (64: 3)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I list the names of
      people, places, and things that cause me to be angry, irritable, unreasonable,
      and discontented. I put them all down. At this time I do not say what they did,
      or why they bother me. I just make the list of who did it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>First
      Column lesson</strong>: My head is full of resentments. There is no room for
      conscious contact with my higher power.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Grudge List &nbsp;

      with the list of names of people, places, and things that make me irritable,
      unreasonable, and discontent, I am ready to fill in the Second Column. For each
      First Column name, I state simply how they hurt me, what happened, what they
      (or I) did that makes me feel the way I do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Second Column
      lesson</strong>: It is less who the person is and more how his/her behavior
      made me angry. May I begin forgiveness of myself and others here?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Grudge

      part of my Self was hurt or threatened and that I reacted to?&rdquo; (64: 3,
      65: 1) &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now for each event in the Second Column, I write
      down in the Third Column what instincts of my Self were hurt or threatened by
      the person, place, or thing. I consider the &lsquo;three S&rsquo;s of Self&rsquo;:
      Security (material and emotional), Society/Self-esteem (fear for very existence),
      Sex (and relationship, companionship) instincts. [See <em>12&amp;12</em>, p.
      49: 0]&nbsp; Also the &lsquo;actor&rsquo;s roles&rsquo; I play. How do my own
      negative feelings and reactions, my own worn out defenses, affect me?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Third
      Column lesson</strong>: I discover that what leads me to a drink is not who
      or how they hurt me, but <strong>the way I RE-ACT</strong> to what part of myself
      that was threatened. My own reactions and my own thought-habits lead me to drink.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Grudge

      &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2.) &nbsp; &nbsp; 2<sup>ND</sup> &nbsp; Working
      of Grudge List (65: 3-66: 2)</strong>: <strong>WHY</strong><strong>?</strong>&nbsp;
      &ldquo;Why must I change?&rdquo; Resentment is a waste of time. My anger leads
      to indignation and self-pity. I will drink again if I think this way. If I drink
      I will die spiritually, mentally, and physically.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3.)
      &nbsp; &nbsp; 3<sup>RD</sup>&nbsp; Working of Grudge List (66: 3-67: 1): </strong><strong>WHEN</strong><strong>?&nbsp;
      &ldquo;</strong>When I am ready, what do I do?&rdquo;&nbsp; <em>They, like ourselves,
      were sick too. We asked God to help us. We avoid retaliation</em>. (67: 0,1)&nbsp;
      Relaxation &nbsp; &nbsp; Meditation / prayer.&nbsp; <strong>*</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4.)
      &nbsp; &nbsp; 4<sup>TH</sup>&nbsp; Working of Grudge List (67: 2)</strong>:
      <strong>WHERE</strong><strong>? &ldquo;</strong>Where am I responsible?&rdquo;&nbsp;
      &nbsp; <em>Disregard the other person involved entirely</em>. (67: 2)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now
      that I have completed the three column chart, I ask myself: What have I done
      to cause myself to feel this way?&nbsp; When have I done this before?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What
      did I do in my conduct in relationship to this person, place, or thing to cause
      me to feel <em>restless, irritable and discontented</em>? (xxviii: 4) Do I have
      unreasonable expectations? Have I been acting out of fear? What am I afraid
      of? Do my own reactions lead me to be hurt and to hurt others? How old is my
      behavior?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Other Columns Lessons</strong>: &nbsp; What
      is my part? &nbsp; [See <em>motives</em> 86: 2]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where was I <strong>selfish</strong>
      (self-absorbed)?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where was I <strong>dishonest</strong>
      (believing my own lies, or not genuine)?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where was I <strong>self-seeking</strong>
      (wanting to control or be controlled by someone else)? (67: 2)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where
      was I <strong>frightened</strong> (where did self-reliance fail me)? (68 :1)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where
      was I <strong>at fault</strong> (out of bounds, or missing the mark)?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What
      could I have done instead? (69: 1,3)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Answers
      to these questions will help me find my character defects, shortcomings, defenses,
      and the <em>exact nature of our wrongs</em> that I will address in Step 5 (59:
      2). [<em>We learned that if we were seriously disturbed, our first need was
      to quiet that disturbance, regardless of who or what we thought caused it</em>.
      <em>12&amp;12</em>, 47: 2]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[AND:&nbsp; I may write about how these
      old worn out defenses blocked me from growing up and growing spiritually &ndash;
      false pride, perfectionism, being phony, selfishness, impatience, self-pity,
      resentments, intolerance, alibis, dishonest thinking, putting things off, guilt
      and shame, fear, taking things for granted, etc., etc.]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>STEP&nbsp;
      4&nbsp; TURNAROUNDS &nbsp; </strong><strong>WILLING</strong><strong> to change&nbsp;
      &nbsp; </strong><strong>*</strong><strong>&nbsp; MEDITATION / PRAYER: &nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Anger</strong>:
      The one that hurt or threatened me is also a sick person. I deeply wish for
      them (and me) the same serenity and peace of mind that I would have for myself.
      God, of my understanding, save me from being hurt, threatened, insulted, or
      angry. How may I help them? (67: 0; 552: 1)&nbsp; (I say this for myself too)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Fear</strong>:
      I pray that my fear be removed and my attention directed to being who you would
      have me be today. May thy will, not mine, be done. (68: 3)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Relationship/Sex</strong>:
      <em>We earnestly pray for the right ideal, for guidance in each questionable
      situation, for sanity, and for the strength to do the right thing</em>.(70:
      2)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Willing to change</strong>: Today I may meditate, go
      to a meeting, talk with my sponsor so I am more open to my higher power and
      less restless, irritable and discontent. Today I do not have to be hurt or to
      hurt myself, and I do not have to drink.</p>\r\n"

      What did the Big Book authors say?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>READ
      &nbsp; &nbsp; </strong>Read about Step 5 in Chapter 6, Into Action, pp. 72 &ndash;
      75.&nbsp; Many read Step 5 in the <em>12 &amp; 12</em>. &nbsp; &nbsp; Step 5

      Book say to me about my practice of Step 5?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We may read
      and discuss Chapter 6, pp. 72- 75 having to do with Step 5.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The
      actual taking of Step 5 is private and will not occur within the group. However,
      group members may speak generally about their experiences and share some of
      their reflective writings about taking Step 5 by the Big Book.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suggestion:
      Be specific and thorough when responding to the session questions. Try to avoid
      rote &#39;yes&#39; and &#39;no&#39; answers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Points
      of Focus and Reflection &nbsp; &nbsp; </strong>(Consider 72-75: 3)<strong> </strong>Cross
      off the bulleted points.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.) &nbsp; We are only as sick
      as our secrets.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>a.)&nbsp; Fear</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step
      4 and Step 5 are the most discussed and the most skipped Steps. Why?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do
      I have any fears or reservations about doing this Step? What are they?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How
      has working the first four Steps prepared me for taking Step 5?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Was
      I so numb that I did not realize my wrongs?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>b.)&nbsp;
      <em>Admitted to God </em></strong>[of our own understanding]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Have
      I opened myself to the presence of a higher power before going over my inventory
      with my Fifth Step sponsor? How do I do this?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How is my Third
      Step decision reaffirmed by working the Fifth Step?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>c.)
      &nbsp; <em>Admitted&hellip;to ourselves</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>How am I
      <em>very much the actor</em>? (73: 1)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Had I been <em>under constant
      fear and tension</em>, and did that make <em>for more drinking</em>? (73: 2)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>d.)
      &nbsp; <em>Admitted&hellip;to another human being</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What
      may happen to those who hang on <em>to some of the worst items in stock</em>,
      or have not <em>told someone else </em><em>all</em><em> their life story</em>?
      (73: 0)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How will working Step 5 help me to begin to develop new
      ways of having relationships?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Am I <em>in complete readiness</em>
      to <em>talk to the right person</em>, (74: 2) and to listen to their response?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2.)&nbsp;
      <em>The exact nature of our wrongs</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Can I &hellip;<em>get
      down to causes and conditions</em>? (64: 0)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Have I inventoried
      <em>my grosser handicaps</em>? (71: 0)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What does <em>the exact
      nature of our defects</em> mean? (72: 1)&nbsp; What is behind my alcoholism
      and the reasons I acted out in the ways I did?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why do I need to
      admit the exact nature &ndash; my own basic starting point <strong>/ </strong>motive
      &ndash; of my wrongs and not simply the wrongs themselves?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What
      is the distinction between my <em>motives</em> (86: 2) and my actions or behaviors?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The
      5th Step promises: Do I now feel I <em>can look the world in the eye</em>? (75:
      2)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>III &nbsp; &nbsp; DAILY PRACTICE
      OF STEP 5 PRINCIPLES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>How may I practice being honest
      with myself, accepting who I am, both the good and the harm that I do, and living
      up to my potential?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where am I responsible and where am I not
      responsible? What patterns would I rather not repeat in the future?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How
      may I practice the courage to share the parts of myself that should <em>never
      see the light of day</em>? (73: 2)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How may I practice being committed
      to trusting this process, trusting another person, and trusting myself to do
      it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How may I practice relying on my higher power, relying on
      the program of recovery and relying on the fellowship?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*

      every twist of character, every dark cranny of the past</em>. (75: 1, 2)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When
      we have admitted to God of our understanding, to ourselves, and to another human
      being the exact nature of our wrongs, then according to the Big Book and under
      the conditions of this day, we have taken Step 5.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &nbsp;An optional written Step 5 inventory is on p. 91 of this workbook. The
      actual taking of this Step will occur outside the group. The group may decide
      to observe taking Step 5 in a manner similar to the way some AA groups celebrate
      anniversaries.<strong>STEP&nbsp; 5 &nbsp; WRITTEN&nbsp; INVENTORY&nbsp; </strong>[optional]<strong>&nbsp;

      Defects</strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In what ways are my defects really basic
      human traits that have been distorted by my own self-centeredness?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In
      what specific ways am I addicted to outside things to change my feelings?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Can
      I list each defect I have and the ways I act on it?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How
      do I feel when I act out on each defect? What feelings do my defects help me
      change or avoid? Is every defect another face of fear?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What would
      my life be like without each defect?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2.)

      of my unwanted defects am I dismayed to find are still here?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which
      of my defects have I had most of my life, and are like survival skills? How
      did each defect (or pattern or defense or role or mask) protect me?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which
      unhealthy behaviors do I seem to repeat over and over?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do I fear
      I cannot change? Does my personality seem to equal my defects?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How
      have I changed so far? What defects do I no longer have to act on?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Can
      I see the principles of 12 Step recovery as being the opposite of my character
      defects?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Am I <em>entirely ready</em> (59: 2) to let my higher
      power set my character defects at one remove from me?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3.)
      &nbsp; Letting Go</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When will the pain of holding on to
      my defects of character become greater than my fear of change? &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Have
      many of my thought-habits brought nothing but pain and degradation to my life?&nbsp;
      Do I need help in dealing with them?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How may I let go through
      prayer and meditation and reflect on my higher power?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How
      does my surrender deepen in this step? Can I relax since I do not do it alone?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What
      action can I take that shows that I am entirely ready?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>III

      has &ldquo;my way&rdquo; landed me in difficulty?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Am I acting
      as my own higher power?&nbsp; [See <em>quit playing God</em>, BB, 62: 3]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How
      does my usefulness to myself and others depend on my being balanced?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How
      does my gratitude for my life in recovery relate to my staying right size?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How
      may I take a new perspective on the world and so act differently?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How
      may I grow to have &ldquo;solution-based&rdquo; thinking?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How
      is <em>humility</em> (55: 4) related to <em>honesty</em> (58: 1) and <em>sanity</em>
      (5: 5; 37: 1) in regards to my own sense of proportion and perspective?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AA
      literature focuses on humility as seeing things in true perspective, as they
      really are. [Optional, see also <em>12&amp;12</em> pp. 48: 0; 58: 1; 72: 2]&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Humility
      is a sense of our own humanness. We are truly just trying our best.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2.)

      by sharing their experience, strength, and hope in this matter of prayer and
      meditation?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How is the Serenity Prayer (<em>12&amp;12</em>,

      my higher power do Steps 6 and 7 for me?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3.)&nbsp;
      <em>Remove our shortcomings</em>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Practice</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why
      are <em>defects of character</em> in Step 6 called <em>shortcomings</em> in
      Step 7? (59: 2)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How is my <em>self-centered fear</em> the <em>chief
      activator</em> of my character defects? [<em>12&amp;12</em> 76: 2]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Can
      I see the many faces of my fear (my defects) and not deny or overlook them?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How
      may I recognize my fear and/or anger, bring it to awareness, and deal with it
      in a healthy manner?&nbsp; Can I ask for help to change my fears?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How
      can I stop building walls, and act instead as if I want to be happy, serene
      and sane?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Am I prepared to take an active role in the new and
      healthier world that I am now a part of?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Can I ask for the strength
      to do the practice?&nbsp; What does the term &lsquo;practice&rsquo; mean to
      me?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>III &nbsp; &nbsp; DAILY PRACTICE
      OF STEP 7 PRINCIPLES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Has my sense of perspective been
      out of proportion lately?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How may I accept my powerlessness
      over my shortcomings as well as my alcoholism?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How may I humbly
      ask for strength, practice spiritual principles, and get out of my higher power&rsquo;s
      way?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Can I become more conscious of my motives and intentions
      before I act?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead of fear and anger, can I respond with love
      and patience?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>May I practice trust and being worthy, by practicing
      being responsible?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, can I do what the alcoholic in me says,
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to do&rdquo;?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Have there been times
      when I have been able to refrain from acting on a character defect and to practice
      a spiritual principle instead? Do I recognize this as the higher power of my

      &nbsp; &nbsp; WITH THE GROUP: &nbsp; &nbsp; PRACTICE &ndash;&nbsp; What does
      the Big Book say to me about my practice of Step 8?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We
      read selections from Into Action pp. 76-84 together. We share our writings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without
      mentioning names, we talk about those we included on our list.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Does
      my list have too many, or too few, people on it?&nbsp; Have I included everyone
      I have ever interacted with? Did I only include people I committed egregious
      acts against?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Points of Focus and
      Reflection &nbsp; </strong>(Consider 76: 3-77: 1; 78: 2-79: 0; 80: 5; 83: 2,
      3)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.)&nbsp; <em>All persons we had harmed</em>&ndash;
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Where had I been at fault?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>How may
      I be clear to myself about my responsibility in the wrongs I have done? [Responsible:
      Able to respond, soberly and appropriately. Accountable. Reliable.]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How
      may I accept my responsibility to other people, yet not accept responsibility
      for other people?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>May I let go of the feeling of responsibility
      for the way certain people treated me?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do I owe amends to
      people who have also harmed me? (77: 1)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Have I put my own name
      on the top of my list of people I have harmed? Why or why not? [see <em>12&amp;12</em>,
      79: 3-80: 0, 1]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2.) What harms have
      I committed against the people on my list?&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>-<em>Business
      acquaintances</em></strong>:&nbsp; (76: 4) Did I not cooperate with others or
      not put in a day&rsquo;s work?&nbsp; Did I pad expense accounts or steal money?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>-<em>Friends
      we have hurt</em></strong>. (76: 4) Have I gossiped or been emotionally unavailable?
      Have I stolen from them? Have I failed to keep in contact?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>-Those
      <em>we hate</em>.</strong> (77: 1) Have I wished ill-will upon them? Have I
      spoken badly of them? Have I committed the harms described above?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>-Our
      creditors</strong>: We <em>owe money</em>. (78: 2)&nbsp; Have I failed to admit
      that money or services are owed? Have I failed to make arrangements to pay what
      is owed?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>-Perhaps we have committed a criminal offense</em></strong>.
      (78: 3) Have I paid my fine and done my time?&nbsp; Have I made a commitment
      not to repeat those crimes?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>-<em>We have domestic troubles</em>.</strong>
      (80: 5) <em>The family</em>, (83: 1) spouse, or <em>parents</em>. (82: 2) Have
      I physically / emotionally / verbally abused my spouse, children, or other family
      members? Have I been emotionally unavailable to those family members?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>-Some
      people cannot be seen.</em></strong> (82: 3)&nbsp; Have I done any or all of
      the above to those I cannot locate or who have died?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3.)
      <em>Willing to make amends to them all</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What have
      I done to become willing to make these amends?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why am I not willing
      to make amends with some of the people on my list? Do I have fear of making
      direct amends? Do I have persistent resentment toward some? Am I unable to see
      the harm I have caused?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In making amends, am I still trying to
      please, or control, or punish, or behave in some other way that interferes with
      an honest relationship? Will it help to revisit Steps 4 and 5, and Steps 6 and
      7 about these issues?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What would my life be like if I had already
      made these amends?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>III &nbsp; &nbsp;
      DAILY PRACTICE OF STEP 8 PRINCIPLES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>How may I move beyond
      my resentments, and blaming others, and believing I was the innocent victim,
      and all my other justifications for the harms I caused?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Are there
      any names I have not added to my list? Am I willing to add them now?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Am
      I beginning to feel compassion and empathy for others, including myself? Describe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How
      may I have peace with my past, so that I may have peace in the present and future?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*

      pages 76-84 in Chapter 6, Into Action on Step 9. ~Support is needed to carry

      1; 83: 1-84: 1)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.) Ask for willingness</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>How
      is making amends a commitment to a continuous process of change?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why
      is making amends more than just saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What
      about financial amends? What behaviors do I need to amend?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do
      I owe amends to people who have also harmed me?&nbsp; (77: 1)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do
      I owe amends to anyone who is dead? What was special about that person that
      I might be able to use in planning my amends?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Am I genuine
      in making my amends, or do I have hidden motives, such as to gain acceptance
      or love from someone else, or to prove them wrong and me right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Can
      I let go of the outcome, knowing that I have no control over the other person&rsquo;s
      response?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2.) <em>Direct amends</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The

      DAILY MEDITATION / PRAYER &nbsp; </strong>Meditation and prayer, like other

      &nbsp; &nbsp; WITH THE GROUP: &nbsp; &nbsp; PRACTICE &ndash; &nbsp; What does
      the Big Book say to me about my practice of Step 11?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We
      review the three meditation / prayer practices of Step 11, BB pp. 85 - 88.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Points
      of Focus and Reflection &nbsp; </strong>(Consider 85: 3-88: 3)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.)
      <em>Prayer and meditation</em>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step 11 begins with
      the word <em>sought </em>(59: 2), the past tense of &ldquo;to seek&rdquo;; how
      and what am I seeking?&nbsp; Do I have a specific spiritual path? &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What
      is my understanding of the differences between religion and spirituality? What
      have I done to explore my own spirituality?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do I recognize that
      a moment of silence is meditation, where I may quiet my mind on a regular basis
      so that I can gain understanding and knowledge from my higher power &ndash;
      my own <em>unsuspected inner resource</em>? (567: 4)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Heard
      in a meeting: &ldquo;Prayer is talking to.&nbsp; Meditation is listening for.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Optional:
      &lsquo;<em>Thy will not mine, be done.&rsquo; &hellip; Just saying it over and
      over will often enable us to clear a channel choked up with anger, fear, frustration,
      or misunderstanding, and permit us to return to the surest help of all &ndash;
      our search for God </em>[of our understanding]<em>&rsquo;s will, not our own,
      in the moment of stress</em>. <em>12&amp;12</em>, 103: 0]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2.)&nbsp;<em>
      Conscious contact</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Big Book authors speak of
      the <strong><em>Retire at night</em> meditation / prayer</strong> (86:1): &hellip;<em>Review
      our day. Were we resentful, selfish, dishonest, or afraid</em>?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Were
      we thinking of ourselves most of the time? &hellip; After making our review
      we ask God </em>[of our understanding]<em>&rsquo;s forgiveness and inquire,
      what corrective measures should be taken</em>? (86: 1)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There
      also is the <strong><em>On awakening</em> meditation / prayer</strong> (86:
      2, 3 - 87: 0, 1, 2):&nbsp; <em>We ask God </em>[of our understanding]<em> to
      direct our thinking, especially asking that it be divorced from self-pity, dishonest
      or self-seeking </em><strong><em>motives</em></strong>. (86: 2)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>We
      ask for freedom from self-will</em>&hellip;. (87: 1)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Be
      quick to see where religious people are right</em>. (87: 2)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And,
      there is the <strong><em>Through the day</em> meditation / prayer</strong> (87:
      3 - 88: 0): &hellip;<em>We </em><strong><em>pause</em></strong><em>, when agitated
      or doubtful, and </em><strong><em>ask</em></strong><em> for the right thought
      or action. We constantly remind ourselves we are no longer running the show,
      humbly saying to ourselves many times each day &lsquo;Thy will be done.</em>&rsquo;
      (87: 3 - 88: 0)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3.) <em>The power
      to carry that out</em>.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why do we pray only for <em>knowledge</em>
      of God&#39;s will for us and <em>the power to carry that out</em>? (59: 2)&nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How does humility apply to this?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>III
      &nbsp; &nbsp; DAILY PRACTICE OF STEP 11 PRINCIPLES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>How
      may I clear away my insistence that I want or I need something, and let things
      be?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How may I remember that I am not in charge of the world?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How
      may I have the faith and courage to seek the knowledge, the will and the power
      to live my life in a way that brings serenity and peace of mind?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How
      may I pass on to others my inner knowing of creation&rsquo;s deep wish of well
      being for me and others?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How may I make a commitment to the practice
      of regular meditation and prayer?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Have I meditated and prayed

      in the loving energy of that wish for you to have deepest well-being, happiness

      of Focus and Reflection &nbsp; </strong>(Read BB Chapter 7. See pp. 109-110
      this workbook.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.) <em>Spiritual awakening as </em></strong><strong><em>the</em></strong><strong><em>

      result of working the Steps?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By doing my own work in Steps 1 through
      11, have I developed a new way of thinking, feeling and acting, and connecting
      with others?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is it my experience that I have undergone <em>a profound
      alteration</em> <em>in</em> [my] <em>reaction</em><em> to life</em>? (567: 4)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Have
      I had a <em>personality change sufficient to bring about recovery</em>? (567:
      1)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What lasting changes have resulted from my spiritual awakening?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having
      awakened to the reality that I too am a good and caring person, can I invite

      my experience, does this message include that there is hope, we are not alone,
      we can stay sober, and we can recover?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did someone carry
      the message to me?&nbsp; (See p. 18: 4,5)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why was an AA member
      able to reach me in a way that no one else ever had?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What

      are the step-by-step requirements for Twelfth Step work? (See BB Chapter 7,
      and this SbBB workbook pp. 109 - 110)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>May I share who I am, where

    - BILL'S STORY
    - "WAR FEVER ran high in the New England town to which we new, young officers
      from Plattsburg were assigned, and we were flattered when the first citizens
      took us to their homes, making us feel heroic.  Here was love, applause, war;
      moments sublime with intervals hilarious.  I was part of life at last, and in
      the midst of the excitement I discovered liquor.  I forgot the strong warnings
      and the prejudices of my people concerning drink.  In time we sailed for 'Over
      There.'  I was very lonely and again turned to alcohol.\r\n    We landed in
      England.  I visited Winchester Cathedral.  Much moved, I wandered outside.  My
      attention was caught by a doggerel on an old tombstone:\r\n                    'Here
      lies a Hampshire Grenadier\r\n                      Who caught his death\r\n
      \                     Drinking cold small beer.\r\n                      A good
      soldier is ne'er forgot\r\n                      Whether he dieth by musket\r\n
      \                                  Or by pot.'\r\n    Ominous warning-which
      I failed to heed.\r\n    Twenty-two, and a veteran of foreign wars, I went home
      at last.  I fancied myself a leader, for had not the men of my battery given
      me a special token of appreciation?  My talent for leadership, I imagined, would
      place me at the head of vast enterprises which I would manage with the utmost
      assurance.\r\n    I took a night law course, and obtained employment as investigator
      for a surety company.  The drive for success was on.  I'd prove to the world
      I was important.  My work took me about Wall Street and little by little I became
      interested in the market.  Many people lost money-but some became very rich.
      \ Why not I?  I studied economics and business as well as law.  Potential  alcoholic
      that I was, I nearly failed my law course.  At one of the finals I was too drunk
      to think or write.  Though my drinking was not yet continuous, it disturbed
      my wife.  We had long talks when I would still her forebodings by telling her
      that men of genius conceived their best projects when drunk; that the most majestic
      constructions of philosophic thought were so derived.\r\n    By the time I had
      completed the course, I knew the law was not for me.  The inviting maelstrom
      of Wall Street had me in its grip.  Business and financial leaders were my heroes.
      \ Out of this alloy of drink and speculation, I commenced to forge the weapon
      that one day would turn in its flight like a boomerang and all but cut me to
      ribbons.  Living modestly, my wife and I saved $1,000.  It went into certain
      securities, then cheap and rather unpopular.  I rightly imagined that they would
      some day have a great rise.  I failed to persuade my broker friends to send
      me out looking over factories and managements, but my wife and I decided to
      go anyway.  I had developed a theory that most people lost money in stocks through
      ignorance of markets.  I discovered many more reasons later on.\r\n    We gave
      up our positions and off we roared on a motorcycle, the sidecar stuffed with
      tent, blankets, a change of clothes, and three huge volumes of a financial reference
      service.  Our friends thought a lunacy commission should be appointed.  Perhaps
      they were right.  I had had some success at speculation, so we had a little
      money, but we once worked on a farm for a month to avoid drawing on our small
      capital.  That was the last honest manual labor on my part for many a day.  We
      covered the whole eastern United States in a year.  At the end of it, my reports
      to Wall Street procured me a position there and the use of a large expense account.
      \ The exercise of an option brought in more money, leaving us with a profit
      of several thousand dollars for that year.\r\n    For the next few years fortune
      threw money and applause my way.  I had arrived.  My judgment and ideas were
      followed by many to the tune of paper millions.  The great boom of the late
      twenties was seething and swelling.  Drink was taking an important and exhilarating
      part in my life.  There was loud talk in the jazz places uptown.  Everyone spent
      in thousands and chattered in millions.  Scoffers could scoff and be damned.
      \ I made a host of fair-weather friends.\r\n    My drinking assumed more serious
      proportions, continuing all day and almost every night.  The remonstrances of
      my friends terminated in a row and I became a lone wolf.  There were many unhappy
      scenes in our sumptuous apartment.  There had been no real infidelity, for loyalty
      to my wife, helped at times by extreme drunkenness, kept me out of those scrapes.\r\n
      \   In 1929 I contracted golf fever.  We went at once to  the country, my wife
      to applaud while I started out to overtake Walter Hagen.  Liquor caught up with
      me much faster than I came up behind Walter.  I began to be jittery in the morning.
      \ Golf permitted drinking every day and every night.  It was fun to carom around
      the exclusive course which had inspired such awe in me as a lad.  I acquired
      the impeccable coat of tan one sees upon the well-to-do.  The local banker watched
      me whirl fat checks in and out of his till with amused skepticism.\r\n    Abruptly
      in October 1929 hell broke loose on the New York stock exchange.  After one
      of those days of inferno, I wobbled from a hotel bar to a brokerage office.
      \ It was eight o'clock-five hours after the market closed.  The ticker still
      clattered.  I was staring at an inch of the tape which bore the inscription
      XYZ-32.  It had been 52 that morning.  I was finished and so were many friends.
      \ The papers reported men jumping to death from the towers of High Finance.
      \ That disgusted me.  I would not jump.  I went back to the bar.  My friends
      had dropped several million since ten o'clock-so what?  Tomorrow was another
      day.  As I drank, the old fierce determination to win came back.\r\n    Next
      morning I telephoned a friend in Montreal.  He had plenty of money left and
      thought I had better go to Canada.  By the following spring we were living in
      our accustomed style.  I felt like Napoleon returning from Elba.  No St. Helena
      for me!  But drinking caught up with me again and my generous friend had to
      let me go.  This time we stayed broke.\r\n    We went to live with my wife's
      parents.  I found a job; then lost it as the result of a brawl with a taxi driver.
      \ Mercifully, no one could guess that I was to have no real employment for five
      years, or hardly draw a sober breath.  My wife began to work in a department
      store, coming home exhausted to find me drunk.  \r\n    I became an unwelcome
      hanger-on at brokerage places.\r\n    Liquor ceased to be a luxury; it became
      a necessity. 'Bathtub' gin, two bottles a day, and often three, got to be routine.
      \ Sometimes a small deal would net a few hundred dollars, and I would pay my
      bills at the bars and delicatessens.  This went on endlessly, and I began to
      waken very early in the morning shaking violently.  A tumbler full of gin followed
      by half a dozen bottles of beer would be required if I were to eat any breakfast.
      \ Nevertheless, I still thought I could control the situation, and there were
      periods of sobriety which renewed my wife's hope.\r\n    Gradually things got
      worse.  The house was taken over by the mortgage holder, my mother-in-law died,
      my wife and father-in-law became ill.\r\n    Then I got a promising business
      opportunity.  Stocks were at the low point of 1932, and I had somehow formed
      a group to buy.  I was to share generously in the profits.  Then I went on a
      prodigious bender, and that chance vanished.\r\n    I woke up.  This had to
      be stopped.  I saw I could not take so much as one drink.  I was through forever.
      \ Before then, I had written lots of sweet promises, but my wife happily observed
      that this time I meant business.  And so I did.\r\n    Shortly afterward I came
      home drunk.  There had been no fight.  Where had been my high resolve?  I simply
      didn't know.  It hadn't even come to mind.  Someone had pushed a drink my way,
      and I had taken it.  Was I crazy?  I began to wonder, for such an appalling
      lack of perspective seemed near being just that.\r\n    Renewing my resolve,
      I tried again.  Some time passed, and confidence began to be replaced by cock-sureness.
      \ I could laugh at the gin mills.  Now I had what it takes!  One day I walked
      into a cafe to telephone.  In no time I was beating on the bar asking myself
      how it happened.  As the whisky rose to my head I told myself I would manage
      better next time, but I might as well get good and drunk then.  And I did.\r\n
      \   The remorse, horror and hopelessness of the next morning are unforgettable.
      \ The courage to do battle was not there.  My brain raced uncontrollably and
      there was a terrible sense of impending calamity.  I hardly dared cross the
      street, lest I collapse and be run down by an early morning truck, for it was
      scarcely daylight.  An all night place supplied me with a dozen glasses of ale.
      \ My writhing nerves were stilled at last.  A morning paper told me the market
      had gone to hell again.  Well, so had I.  The market would recover, but I wouldn't.
      \ That was a hard thought.  Should I kill myself?  No-not now.  Then a mental
      fog settled down.  Gin would fix that.  So two bottles, and-oblivion.\r\n    The
      mind and body are marvelous mechanisms, for mine endured this agony two more
      years.  Sometimes I stole from my wife's slender purse when the morning terror
      and madness were on me.  Again I swayed dizzily before an open window, or the
      medicine cabinet where there was poison, cursing myself for a weakling.  There
      were flights from city to country and back, as my wife and I sought escape.
      \ Then came the night when the physical and mental torture was so hellish I
      feared I would burst through my window, sash and all.  Somehow I managed to
      drag my mattress to a lower floor, lest I suddenly leap.  A doctor came with
      a heavy sedative.  Next day found me drinking both gin and sedative.  This combination
      soon landed me on the rocks.  People feared for my sanity.  So did I.  I could
      eat little or nothing when drinking, and I was forty pounds under weight.\r\n
      \   My brother-in-law is a physician, and through his kindness and that of my
      mother I was placed in a nationally-known hospital for the mental and physical
      rehabilitation of alcoholics.  Under the so-called belladonna treatment my brain
      cleared.  Hydrotherapy and mild exercise helped much.  Best of all, I met a
      kind doctor who explained that though certainly selfish and foolish, I had been
      seriously ill, bodily and mentally.\r\n    It relieved me somewhat to learn
      that in alcoholics the will is amazingly weakened when it comes to combating
      liquor, though it often remains strong in other respects.  My incredible behavior
      in the face of a desperate desire to stop was explained.  Understanding myself
      now, I fared forth in high hope.  For three for four months the goose hung high.
      \ I went to town regularly and even made a little money.  Surely this was the
      answer-self-knowledge.\r\n    But it was not, for the frightful day came when
      I drank once more.  The curve of my declining moral and bodily health fell off
      like a ski-jump.  After a time I returned to the hospital.  This was the finish,
      the curtain, it seemed to me.  My weary and despairing wife was informed that
      it would all end with heart failure during delirium tremens, or I would develop
      a wet brain, perhaps within a year.  She would soon have to give me over to
      the undertaker or the asylum.\r\n    They did not need to tell me.  I knew,
      and almost welcomed the idea.  It was a devastating blow to my pride.  I, who
      had thought so well of myself and my abilities, of my capacity to surmount obstacles,
      was cornered at last.  Now I was to plunge into the dark, joining that endless
      procession of sots who had gone on before.  I thought of my poor wife.  There
      had been much happiness after all.  What would I not give to make amends.  But
      that was over now.\r\n    No words can tell of the loneliness and despair I
      found in that bitter morass of self-pity.  Quicksand stretched around me in
      all directions.  I had met my match.  I had been overwhelmed. Alcohol was my
      master.\r\n    Trembling, I stepped from the hospital a broken man.  Fear sobered
      me for a bit.  Then came the insidious insanity of that first drink, and on
      Armistice Day 1934, I was off again.  Everyone became resigned to the certainty
      that I would have to be shut up somewhere, or would stumble along to a miserable
      end.  How dark it is before the dawn!  In reality that was the beginning of
      my last debauch.  I was soon to be catapulted into what I like to call the fourth
      dimension of existence.  I was to know happiness, peace, and usefulness, in
      a way of life that is incredibly more wonderful as time passes.\r\n    Near
      the end of that bleak November, I sat drinking in my kitchen.  With a certain
      satisfaction I reflected there was enough gin concealed about the house to carry
      me through that night and the next day.  My wife was at work.  I wondered whether
      I dared hide a full bottle of gin near the head of our bed.  I would need it
      before daylight.\r\n    My musing was interrupted by the telephone.  The cheery
      voice of an old school friend asked if he might come over.  He was sober.  It
      was years since I could remember his coming to New York in that condition.  I
      was amazed.  Rumor had it that he had been committed for alcoholic insanity.
      \ I wondered how he had escaped.  Of course he would have dinner, and then I
      could drink openly with him.  Unmindful of his welfare, I thought only of recapturing
      the spirit of other days.  There was that time we had chartered an airplane
      to complete a jag!  His coming was an oasis in this dreary desert of futility.
      \ The very thing-an oasis!  Drinkers are like that.\r\n    The door opened and
      he stood there, fresh-skinned and glowing.  There was something about his eyes.
      \ He was inexplicably different.  What had happened?\r\n    I pushed a drink
      across the table.  He refused it.  Disappointed but curious, I wondered what
      had got into the fellow.  He wasn't himself.\r\n    'Come, what's this all about?'
      I queried.\r\n    He looked straight at me.  Simply, but smilingly, he said,
      'I've got religion.'\r\n    I was aghast.  So that was it-last summer an alcoholic
      crackpot; now, I suspected, a little cracked about religion.  He had that starry-eyed
      look.  Yes, the old boy was on fire all right.  But bless his heart, let him
      rant!  Besides, my gin would last longer than his preaching.\r\n    But he did
      no ranting.  In a matter of fact way he told how two men had appeared in court,
      persuading the judge to suspend his commitment.  They had told of a simple religious
      idea and a practical program of action.  That was two months ago and the result
      was self-evident.  It worked!\r\n    He had come to pass his experience along
      to me-if I cared to have it.  I was shocked, but interested.  Certainly I was
      interested.  I had to be, for I was hopeless.\r\n    He talked for hours.  Childhood
      memories rose before me.  I could almost hear the sound of the preacher's voice
      as I sat, on still Sundays, way over there on the hillside;  there was that
      proffered temperance pledge I never signed; my grandfather's good natured contempt
      of some church folk and their doings; his insistence that the spheres really
      had their music; but his denial of the preacher's right to tell him how he must
      listen; his fearlessness as he spoke of these things just before he died; these
      recollections welled up from the past.  They made me swallow hard.\r\n    That
      war-time day in old Winchester Cathedral came back again.\r\n    I had always
      believed in a Power greater than myself.  I had often pondered these things.
      \ I was not an atheist.  Few people really are, for that means blind faith in
      the strange proposition that this universe originated in a cipher and aimlessly
      rushes nowhere.  My intellectual heroes, the chemists, the astronomers, even
      the evolutionists, suggested vast laws and forces at work.  Despite contrary
      \ indications, I had little doubt that a mighty purpose and rhythm underlay
      all.  How could there be so much of precise and immutable law, and no intelligence?
      \ I simply had to believe in a Spirit of the Universe, who knew neither time
      nor limitation.  But that was as far as I had gone.\r\n    With ministers, and
      the world's religions, I parted right there.  When they talked of a God personal
      to me, who was love, superhuman strength and direction, I became irritated and
      my mind snapped shut against such a theory.\r\n    To Christ I conceded the
      certainty of a great man, not too closely followed by those who claimed Him.
      \ His moral teaching-most excellent.  For myself, I had adopted those parts
      which seemed convenient and not too difficult; the rest I disregarded.\r\n    The
      wars which had been fought, the burnings and chicanery that religious dispute
      had facilitated, made me sick.  I honestly doubted whether, on balance, the
      religions of mankind had done any good.  Judging from what I had seen in Europe
      and since, the power of God in human affairs was negligible, the Brotherhood
      of Man a grim jest.  If there was a Devil, he seemed the Boss Universal, and
      he certainly had me.\r\n    But my friend sat before me, and he made the point-blank
      declaration that God had done for him what he could not do for himself.  His
      human will had failed.  Doctors had pronounced him incurable.  Society was about
      to lock him up.  Like myself, he had admitted complete defeat.  Then he had,
      in effect, been raised from the dead, suddenly taken from the scrap heap to
      a level of life better than the best he had ever known!\r\n    Had this power
      originated in him?  Obviously it had not.  There had been no more power in him
      than there was in me at the minute; and this was none at all.\r\n    That floored
      me.  It began to look as though religious people were right after all.  Here
      was something at work in a human heart which had done the impossible.  My ideas
      about miracles were drastically revised right then.  Never mind the musty past;
      here sat a miracle directly across the kitchen table.  He shouted great tidings.\r\n
      \   I saw that my friend was much more than inwardly reorganized.  He was on
      a different footing.  His roots grasped a new soil.\r\n    Despite the living
      example of my friend there remained in me the vestiges of my old prejudice.
      \ The word God still aroused a certain antipathy.  When the thought was expressed
      that there might be a God personal to me this feeling was intensified.  I didn't
      like the idea.  I could go for such conceptions as Creative Intelligence, Universal
      Mind or Spirit of Nature but I resisted the thought of a Czar of the Heavens,
      however loving His sway might be.  I have since talked with scores of men who
      felt the same way.\r\n    My friend suggested what then seemed a novel idea.
      \ He said, 'Why don't you choose your own conception of God?'\r\n    That statement
      hit me hard.  It melted the icy intellectual mountain in whose shadow I had
      lived and shivered many years.  I stood in the sunlight at last.\r\n    It was
      only a matter of being willing to believe in a Power greater than myself.  Nothing
      more was required of me to make my beginning.  I saw that growth could start
      from that point.  Upon a foundation of complete willingness I might build what
      I saw in my friend.  Would I have it?  Of course I would!\r\n    Thus was I
      convinced that God is concerned with us humans when we want Him enough.  At
      long last I saw, I felt, I believed.  Scales of pride and prejudice fell from
      my eyes.  A new world came into view.\r\n    The real significance of my experience
      in the Cathedral burst upon me.  For a brief moment, I had needed and wanted
      God.  There had been a humble willingness to have Him with me-and He came.  But
      soon the sense of His presence had been blotted out by worldly clamors, mostly
      those within myself.  And so it had been ever since.  How blind I had been.\r\n
      \   At the hospital I was separated from alcohol for the last time.  Treatment
      seemed wise, for I showed signs of delirium tremens.\r\n    There I humbly offered
      myself to God, as I then understood Him, to do with me as He would.  I placed
      myself unreservedly under His care and direction.  I admitted for the first
      time that of myself I was nothing; that without Him I was lost.  I ruthlessly
      faced my sins and became willing to have my new-found Friend take them away,
      root and branch.  I have not had a drink since.\r\n    My schoolmate visited
      me, and I fully acquainted him with my problems and deficiencies.  We made a
      list of people I had hurt or toward whom I felt resentment.  I expressed my
      entire willingness to approach these individuals, admitting my wrong.  Never
      was I to be critical of them.  I was to right all such matters to the utmost
      of my ability.\r\n    I was to test my thinking by the new God-consciousness
      within.  Common sense would thus become uncommon sense.  I was to sit quietly
      when in doubt, asking only for direction and strength to meet my problems as
      He would have me.  Never was I to pray for myself, except as my requests bore
      on my usefulness to others.  Then only might I expect to receive.  But that
      would be in great measure.\r\n    My friend promised when these things were
      done I would enter upon a new relationship with my Creator; that I would have
      the elements of a way of living which answered all my problems.  Belief in the
      power of God, plus enough willingness, honesty and humility to establish and
      maintain the new order of things, were the essential requirements.\r\n    Simple,
      but not easy; a price had to be paid.  It meant destruction of self-centeredness.
      \ I must turn in all things to the Father of Light who presides over us all.\r\n
      \   These were revolutionary and drastic proposals, but the moment I fully accepted
      them, the effect was electric.  There was a sense of victory, followed by such
      a peace and serenity as I had never known.  There was utter confidence.  I felt
      lifted up, as though the great clean wind of a mountain top blew through and
      through.  God comes to most men gradually, but His impact on me was sudden and
      profound.\r\n    For a moment I was alarmed, and called my friend, the doctor,
      to ask if I were still sane.  He listened in wonder as I talked.\r\n    Finally
      he shook his head saying, 'Something has happened to you I don't understand.
      \ But you had better hang on to it.  Anything is better than the way you were.'
      \ The good doctor now sees many men who have such experiences.  He knows that
      they are real.\r\n    While I lay in the hospital the thought came that there
      were thousands of hopeless alcoholics who might be glad to have what had been
      so freely given me.  Perhaps I could help some of them.  They in turn might
      work with others.\r\n    My friend had emphasized the absolute necessity of
      demonstrating these principles in all my affairs.  Particularly was it imperative
      to work with others as he had worked with me.  Faith without works was dead,
      he said.  And how appallingly true for the alcoholic!  For if an alcoholic failed
      to perfect and enlarge his spiritual life through work and self-sacrifice for
      others, he could not survive the certain trials and low spots ahead.  If he
      did not work, he would surely drink again, and if he drank, he would surely
      die.  Then faith would be dead indeed.  With us it is just like that.\r\n    My
      wife and I abandoned ourselves with enthusiasm to the idea of helping other
      alcoholics to a solution of their problems.  It was fortunate, for my old business
      associates remained skeptical for a year and a half, during which I found little
      work.  I was not too well at the time, and was plagued by waves of self-pity
      and resentment.  This sometimes nearly drove me back to drink, but I soon found
      that when all other measures failed, work with another alcoholic would save
      the day.  Many times I have gone to my old hospital in despair.  On talking
      to a man there, I would be amazingly lifted up and set on my feet.  It is a
      design for living that works in rough going.\r\n    We commenced to make many
      fast friends and a fellowship has grown up among us of which it is a wonderful
      thing to feel a part.  The joy of living we really have, even under pressure
      and difficulty.  I have seen hundreds of families set their feet in the path
      that really goes somewhere; have seen the most impossible domestic situations
      righted; feuds and bitterness of all sorts wiped out.  I have seen men come
      out of asylums and resume a vital place in the lives of their families and communities.
      \ Business and professional men have regained their standing.  There is scarcely
      any form of trouble and misery which has not been overcome among us.  In one
      western city and its environs there are one thousand of us and our families.
      \ We meet frequently so that newcomers may find the fellowship they seek.  At
      these informal gatherings one may often see from 50 to 200 persons.  We are
      growing in numbers and power.\r\n    An alcoholic in his cups is an unlovely
      creature.  Our struggles with them are variously strenuous, comic, and tragic.
      \ One poor chap committed suicide in my home.  He could not, or would not, see
      our way of life.\r\n    There is, however a vast amount of fun about it all.
      \ I suppose some would be shocked at our seeming worldliness and levity.  But
      just underneath there is deadly earnestness.  Faith has to work twenty-four
      hours a day in and through us, or we perish.\r\n    Most of us feel we need
      look no further for Utopia.  We have it with us right here and now.  Each day
      my friend's simple talk in our kitchen multiplies itself in a widening circle
      of peace on earth and good will to men."

    - THERE IS A SOLUTION
    - "WE, OF ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, know thousands of men and women who were once
      just as hopeless as Bill.  Nearly all have recovered.  They have solved the
      drink problem.\r\n    We are average Americans.  All sections of this country
      and many of its occupations are represented, as well as many political, economic,
      social, and religious backgrounds.  We are people who normally would not mix.
      \ But there exists among us a fellowship, a friendliness, and an understanding
      which is indescribably wonderful.  We are like the passengers of a great liner
      the moment after rescue from shipwreck when camaraderie, joyousness and democracy
      pervade the vessel from steerage to Captain's table.  Unlike the feelings of
      the ship's passengers, however, our joy in escape from disaster does not subside
      as we go our individual ways.  The feeling of having shared in a common peril
      is one element in the powerful cement which binds us.  But that in itself would
      never have held us together as we are now joined.\r\n    The tremendous fact
      for every one of us is that we have discovered a common solution.  We have a
      way out on which we can absolutely agree, and upon which we can join in brotherly
      and harmonious action.  This is the great news this book carries to those who
      suffer from alcoholism.\r\n    An illness of this sort-and we have come to believe
      it an illness-involves those about us in a way no other human sickness can.
      \ If a person has cancer all are sorry for him and no one is angry or hurt.
      \ But not so with the alcoholic illness, for with it there goes annihilation
      of all the things worth while in life.  It engulfs all whose lives touch the
      sufferer's.  It brings misunderstanding, fierce resentment, financial insecurity,
      disgusted friends and employers, warped lives of blameless children, sad wives
      and parents-anyone can increase the list.\r\n    We hope this volume will inform
      and comfort those who are, or who may be affected.  There are many.\r\n    Highly
      competent psychiatrists who have dealt with us have found it sometimes impossible
      to persuade an alcoholic to discuss his situation without reserve.  Strangely
      enough, wives, parents and intimate friends usually find us even more unapproachable
      than do the psychiatrist and the doctor.\r\n    But the ex-problem drinker who
      has found this solution, who is properly armed with facts about himself, can
      generally win the entire confidence of another alcoholic in a few hours.  Until
      such an understanding is reached, little or nothing can be accomplished.  \r\n
      \   That the man who is making the approach has had  the same difficulty, that
      he obviously knows what he is talking about, that his whole deportment shouts
      at the new prospect that he is a man with a real answer, that he has no attitude
      of Holier Than Thou, nothing whatever except the sincere desire to be helpful;
      that there are no fees to pay, no axes to grind, no people to please, no lectures
      to be endured-these are the conditions we have found most effective.  After
      such an approach many take up their beds and walk again.\r\n    None of us makes
      a sole vocation of this work, nor do we think its effectiveness would be increased
      if we did.  We feel that elimination of our drinking is but a beginning.  A
      much more important demonstration of our principles lies before us in our respective
      homes, occupations and affairs.  All of us spend much of our spare time in the
      sort of effort which we are going to describe.  A few are fortunate enough to
      be so situated that they can give nearly all their time to the work.\r\n    If
      we keep on the way we are going there is little doubt that much good will result,
      but the surface of the problem would hardly be scratched.  Those of us who live
      in large cities are overcome by the reflection that close by hundreds are dropping
      into oblivion every day.  Many could recover if they had the opportunity we
      have enjoyed.  How then shall we present that which has been so freely given
      us?\r\n    We have concluded to publish an anonymous volume setting forth the
      problem as we see it.  We shall bring to the task our combined experience and
      knowledge.  This should suggest a useful program for anyone concerned with a
      drinking problem.\r\n    Of necessity there will have to be discussion of matters
      medical, psychiatric, social, and religious.  We are aware that these matters
      are, from their very nature, controversial.  Nothing would please us so much
      as to write a book which would contain no basis for contention or argument.
      \ We shall do our utmost to achieve that ideal.  Most of us sense that real
      tolerance of other people's shortcomings and viewpoints and a respect for their
      opinions are attitudes which make us more useful to others.  Our very lives,
      as ex-problem drinkers, depend upon our constant thought of others and how we
      may help meet their needs.\r\n    You may already have asked yourself why it
      is that all of us became so very ill from drinking.  Doubtless you are curious
      to discover how and why, in the face of expert opinion to the contrary, we have
      recovered from a hopeless condition of mind and body.  If you are an alcoholic
      who wants to get over it, you may already be asking-'What do I have to do?'\r\n
      \   It is the purpose of this book to answer such questions specifically.  We
      shall tell you what we have done.  Before going into a detailed discussion,
      it may be well to summarize some points as we see them.\r\n    How many times
      people have said to us: 'I can take it or leave it alone.  Why can't he?'  'Why
      don't you drink like a gentleman or quit?'  'That fellow can't handle his liquor.'
      \ 'Why don't you try beer and wine?'  'Lay off the hard stuff.'  'His will power
      must be weak.'  'He could stop if he wanted to.'  'She's such a sweet girl,
      I should think he'd stop for her sake.'  'The doctor told him that if he ever
      drank again it would kill him, but there he is all lit up again.'\r\n    Now
      these are commonplace observations on drinkers which we hear all the time.  Back
      of them is a world of ignorance and misunderstanding.  We see that these expressions
      refer to people whose reactions are very different from ours.\r\n    Moderate
      drinkers have little trouble in giving up liquor entirely if they have good
      reason for it.  They can take it or leave it alone.\r\n    Then we have a certain
      type of hard drinker.  He may have the habit badly enough to gradually impair
      him physically and mentally.  It may cause him to die a few years before his
      time.  If a sufficiently strong reason-ill health, falling in love, change of
      environment, or the warning of a doctor-becomes operative, this man can also
      stop or moderate, although he may find it difficult and troublesome and may
      even need medical attention.\r\n    But what about the real alcoholic?  He may
      start off as a moderate drinker; he may or may not become a continuous hard
      drinker; but at some stage of his drinking career he begins to lose all control
      of his liquor consumption, once he starts to drink.\r\n    Here is the fellow
      who has been puzzling you, especially in his lack of control.  He does absurd,
      incredible, tragic  things while drinking.  He is a real Dr. Jekyll and Mr.
      Hyde.  He is seldom mildly intoxicated.  He is always more or less insanely
      drunk.  His disposition  while drinking resembles his normal nature but little.
      \ He may be one of the finest fellows in the world.  Yet let him drink for a
      day, and he frequently becomes disgustingly, and even dangerously anti-social.
      \ He has a positive genius for getting tight at exactly the wrong moment, particularly
      when some important decision must be made or engagement kept.  He is often perfectly
      sensible and well balanced concerning everything except liquor, but in that
      respect he is incredibly dishonest and selfish.  He often possesses special
      abilities, skills, and aptitudes, and has a promising career ahead of him.  He
      uses his gifts to build up a bright outlook for his family and himself, and
      then pulls the structure down on his head by a senseless series of sprees.  He
      is the fellow who goes to bed so intoxicated he ought to sleep the clock around.
      \ Yet early next morning he searches madly for the bottle he misplaced the night
      before.  If he can afford it, he may have liquor concealed all over his house
      to be certain no one gets his entire supply away from him to throw down the
      wastepipe.  As matters grow worse, he begins to use a combination of high-powered
      sedative and liquor to quiet his nerves so he can go to work.  Then comes the
      day when he simply cannot make it and gets drunk all over again.  Perhaps he
      goes to a doctor who gives him morphine or some sedative with which to taper
      off.  Then he begins to appear at hospitals and sanitariums.\r\n    This is
      by no means a comprehensive picture of the true alcoholic, as our behavior patterns
      vary.  But this description should identify him roughly.\r\n    Why does he
      behave like this?  If hundreds of experiences have shown him that one drink
      means another debacle with all its attendant suffering and humiliation, why
      is it he takes that one drink?  Why can't he stay on the water wagon?  What
      has become of the common sense and will power that he still sometimes displays
      with respect to other matters?\r\n    Perhaps there never will be a full answer
      to these questions.  Opinions vary considerably as to why the alcoholic reacts
      differently from normal people.  We are not sure why, once a certain point is
      reached, little can be done for him.  We cannot answer the riddle.\r\n    We
      know that while the alcoholic keeps away from drink, as he may do for months
      or years, he reacts much like other men.  We are equally positive that once
      he takes any alcohol whatever into his system, something happens, both in the
      bodily and mental sense, which makes it virtually impossible for him to stop.
      \ The experience of any alcoholic will abundantly confirm this.\r\n    These
      observations would be academic and pointless if our friend never took the first
      drink, thereby setting the terrible cycle in motion.  Therefore, the main problem
      of the alcoholic centers in his mind, rather than in his body.  If you ask him
      why he started on that last bender, the chances are he will offer you any one
      of a hundred alibis.  Sometimes these excuses have a certain plausibility, but
      none of them really makes sense in the light of the havoc an alcoholic's drinking
      bout creates.  They sound like the philosophy of the man who, having a headache,
      beats himself on the head with a hammer so that he can't feel the ache.  If
      you draw this fallacious reasoning to the attention of an alcoholic, he will
      laugh it off, or become irritated and refuse to talk.\r\n    Once in a while
      he may tell the truth.  And the truth, strange to say, is usually that he has
      no more idea why he took that first drink than you have.  Some drinkers have
      excuses with which they are satisfied part of the time.  But in their hearts
      they really do not know why they do it.  Once this malady has a real hold, they
      are a baffled lot.  There is the obsession that somehow, someday, they will
      beat the game.  But they often suspect they are down for the count.\r\n    How
      true this is, few realize.  In a vague way their families and friends sense
      that these drinkers are abnormal, but everybody hopefully awaits the day when
      the sufferer will rouse himself from his lethargy and assert his power of will.\r\n
      \   The tragic truth is that if the man be a real alcoholic, the happy day may
      not arrive.  He has lost control.  At a certain point in the drinking of every
      alcoholic, he passes into a state where the most powerful desire to stop drinking
      is of absolutely no avail.  This tragic situation has already arrived in practically
      every case long before it is suspected.\r\n    The fact is that most alcoholics,
      for reasons yet obscure, have lost the power of choice in drink.  Our  so-called
      will power becomes practically nonexistent.  We are unable, at certain times,
      to bring into our consciousness with sufficient force the memory of the suffering
      and humiliation of even a week or a month ago.  We are without defense against
      the first drink.\r\n    The almost certain consequences that follow taking even
      a glass of beer do not crowd into the mind to deter us.  If these thoughts occur,
      they are hazy and readily supplanted with the old threadbare idea that this
      time we shall handle ourselves like other people.  There is a complete failure
      of the kind of defense that keeps one from putting his hand on a hot stove.\r\n
      \   The alcoholic may say to himself in the most casual way, 'It won't burn
      me this time, so here's how!'  Or perhaps he doesn't think at all.  How often
      have some of us begun to drink in this nonchalant way, and after the third or
      fourth, pounded on the bar and said to ourselves, 'For God's sake, how did I
      ever get started again?'  Only to have that thought supplanted by 'Well, I'll
      stop with the sixth drink.'  Or 'What's the use anyhow?'\r\n    When this sort
      of thinking is fully established in an individual with alcoholic tendencies,
      he has probably placed himself beyond human aid, and unless locked up, may die
      or go permanently insane.  These stark and ugly facts have been confirmed by
      legions of alcoholics throughout history.  But for the grace of God, there would
      have been thousands more convincing demonstrations.  So many want to stop but
      cannot.\r\n    There is a solution.  Almost none of us liked the self-searching,
      the leveling of our pride, the confession of shortcomings which the process
      requires for its successful consummation.  But we saw that it really worked
      in others, and we had come to believe in the hopelessness and futility of life
      as we had been living it.  When, therefore, we were approached by those in whom
      the problem had been solved, there was nothing left for us but to pick up the
      simple kit of spiritual tools laid at our feet.  We have found much of heaven
      and we have been rocketed into a fourth dimension of existence of which we had
      not even dreamed.\r\n    The great fact is just this, and nothing less:  That
      we have had deep and effective spiritual experiences which have revolutionized
      our whole attitude toward life, toward our fellows and toward God's universe.
      \ The  central fact of our lives today is the absolute certainty that our Creator
      has entered into our hearts and lives in a way which is indeed miraculous.  He
      has commenced to accomplish those things for us which we could never do by ourselves.\r\n
      \   If you are as seriously alcoholic as we were, we believe there is no middle-of-the-road
      solution.  We were in a position where life was becoming impossible, and if
      we had passed into the region from which there is no return through human aid,
      we had but two alternatives:  One was to go on to the bitter end, blotting out
      the consciousness of our intolerable situation as best we could; and the other,
      to accept spiritual help.  This we did because we honestly wanted to, and were
      willing to make the effort.\r\n    A certain American business man had ability,
      good sense, and high character.  For years he had floundered from one sanitarium
      to another.  He had consulted the best known American psychiatrists.  Then he
      had gone to Europe, placing himself in the care of a celebrated physician (the
      psychiatrist, Dr. Jung) who prescribed for him.  Though experience had made
      him skeptical, he finished his treatment with unusual confidence.  His physical
      and mental condition were unusually good.  Above all, he believed he had acquired
      such a profound knowledge of the inner workings of his mind and its hidden springs
      that relapse was unthinkable.  Nevertheless, he was drunk in a short time.  More
      baffling still, he could give himself no satisfactory explanation for his fall.\r\n
      \   So he returned to this doctor, whom he admired, and asked him point-blank
      why he could not recover.  He wished above all things to regain self-control.
      \ He seemed quite rational and well-balanced with respect to other problems.
      \ Yet he had no control whatever over alcohol.  Why was this?\r\n    He begged
      the doctor to tell him the whole truth, and he got it.  In the doctor's judgment
      he was utterly hopeless; he could never regain his position in society and he
      would have to place himself under lock and key or hire a bodyguard if he expected
      to live long.  That was a great physician's opinion.\r\n    But this man still
      lives, and is a free man.  He does not need a bodyguard nor is he confined.
      \ He can go anywhere on this earth where other free men may go without disaster,
      provided he remains willing to maintain a certain simple attitude.\r\n    Some
      of our alcoholic readers may think they can do without spiritual help.  Let
      us tell you the rest of the  conversation our friend had with his doctor.\r\n
      \   The doctor said:  'You have the mind of a chronic alcoholic.  I have never
      seen one single case recover, where that state of mind existed to the extent
      that it does in you.'  Our friend felt as though the gates of hell had closed
      on him with a clang.\r\n    He said to the doctor, 'Is there no exception?'\r\n
      \   'Yes,' replied the doctor,' there is.  Exceptions to cases such as yours
      have been occurring since early times.  Here and there, once in a while, alcoholics
      have had what are called vital spiritual experiences.  To me these occurrences
      are phenomena.  They appear to be in the nature of huge emotional displacements
      and rearrangements.  Ideas, emotions, and attitudes which were once the guiding
      forces of the lives of these men are suddenly cast to one side, and a completely
      new set of conceptions and motives begin to dominate them.  In fact, I have
      been trying to produce some such emotional rearrangement within you.  With many
      individuals the methods which I employed are successful, but I have never been
      successful with an alcoholic of your description.'\r\n    Upon hearing this,
      our friend was somewhat relieved, for he reflected that, after all, he was a
      good church  member.  This hope, however, was destroyed by the doctor's telling
      him that while his religious convictions were very good, in his case they did
      not spell the necessary vital spiritual experience.\r\n    Here was the terrible
      dilemma in which our friend found himself when he had the extraordinary experience,
      which as we have already told you, made him a free man.  \r\n    We, in our
      turn, sought the same escape with all the desperation of drowning men.  What
      seemed at first a flimsy reed, has proved to be the loving and powerful hand
      of God.  A new life has been given us or, if you prefer, 'a design for living'
      that really works.\r\n    The distinguished American psychologist, William James,
      in his book 'Varieties of Religious Experience,' indicates a multitude of ways
      in which men have discovered God.  We have no desire to convince anyone that
      there is only one way by which faith can be acquired.  If what we have learned
      and felt and seen means anything at all, it means that all of us, whatever our
      race, creed, or color are the children of a living Creator with whom we may
      form a relationship upon simple and understandable terms as soon as we are willing
      and honest enough to try.  Those having religious affiliations will find here
      nothing disturbing to their beliefs or ceremonies.  There is no friction among
      us over such matters.\r\n    We think it no concern of ours what religious bodies
      our members identify themselves with as individuals.  This should be an entirely
      personal affair which each one decides for himself in the light of past associations,
      or his present choice.  Not all of us join religious bodies, but most of us
      favor such memberships.\r\n    In the following chapter, there appears an explanation
      of alcoholism, as we understand it, then a chapter addressed to the agnostic.
      \ Many who once were in this class are now among our members.  Surprisingly
      enough, we find such convictions no great obstacle to a spiritual experience.\r\n
      \   Further on, clear-cut directions are given showing how we recovered.  These
      are followed by forty-three personal experiences.\r\n    Each individual, in
      the personal stories, describes in his own language and from his own point of
      view the way he established his relationship with God.  These give a fair cross
      section of our membership and a clear-cut idea of what has actually happened
      in their lives.\r\n    We hope no one will consider these self-revealing accounts
      in bad taste.  Our hope is that many alcoholic men and women, desperately in
      need, will see these pages, and we believe that it is only by fully disclosing
      ourselves and our problems that they will be persuaded to say, 'Yes, I am one
      of them too; I must have this thing.'"

    - MORE ABOUT ALCOHOLISM
    - "MOST OF us have been unwilling to admit we were real alcoholics.  No person
      likes to think he is bodily and mentally different from his fellows.  Therefore,
      it is not surprising that our drinking careers have been characterized by countless
      vain attempts to prove we could drink like other people.  The idea that somehow,
      someday he will control and enjoy his drinking is the great obsession of every
      abnormal drinker.  The persistence of this illusion is astonishing.  Many pursue
      it into the gates of insanity or death.\r\n    We learned that we had to fully
      concede to our innermost selves that we were alcoholics.  This is the first
      step in recovery.  The delusion that we are like other people, or presently
      may be, has to be smashed.\r\n    We alcoholics are men and women who have lost
      the ability to control our drinking.  We know that no real alcoholic ever recovers
      control.  All of us felt at times that we were regaining control, but such intervals-usually
      brief-were inevitably followed by still less control, which led in time to pitiful
      and incomprehensible demoralization.  We are convinced to a man that alcoholics
      of our type are in the grip of a progressive illness.  Over any considerable
      period we get worse, never better.\r\n    We are like men who have lost their
      legs; they never grow new ones.  Neither does there appear to be any kind of
      treatment which will make alcoholics of our kind like other men.  We have tried
      every imaginable remedy.  In some instances there has been brief recovery, followed
      always by a still worse relapse.  Physicians who are familiar with alcoholism
      agree there is no such thing as making a normal drinker out of an alcoholic.
      \ Science may one day accomplish this, but it hasn't done so yet.\r\n    Despite
      all we can say, many who are real alcoholics are not going to believe they are
      in that class.  By every form of self-deception and experimentation, they will
      try to prove themselves exceptions to the rule, therefore nonalcoholic.  If
      anyone who is showing inability to control his drinking can do the right- about-face
      and drink like a gentleman, our hats are off to him.  Heaven knows, we have
      tried hard enough and long enough to drink like other people!\r\n    Here are
      some of the methods we have tried: Drinking beer only, limiting the number of
      drinks, never drinking alone, never drinking in the morning, drinking only at
      home, never having it in the house, never drinking during business hours, drinking
      only at parties, switching from scotch to brandy, drinking only natural wines,
      agreeing to resign if ever drunk on the job, taking a trip, not taking a trip,
      swearing off forever (with and without a solemn oath), taking more physical
      exercise, reading inspirational books, going to health farms and sanitariums,
      accepting voluntary commitment to asylums-we could increase the list ad infinitum.\r\n
      \   We do not like to pronounce any individual as  alcoholic, but you can quickly
      diagnose yourself.  Step over to the nearest barroom and try some controlled
      drinking.  Try to drink and stop abruptly.  Try it more than once.  It will
      not take long for you to decide, if you are honest with yourself about it.  It
      may be worth a bad case of jitters if you get a full knowledge of your  condition.\r\n
      \   Though there is no way of proving it, we believe that early in our drinking
      careers most of us could have stopped drinking.  But the difficulty is that
      few alcoholics have enough desire to stop while there is yet time.  We have
      heard of a few instances where people, who showed definite signs of alcoholism,
      were able to stop for a long period because of an overpowering desire to do
      so.  Here is one.\r\n    A man of thirty was doing a great deal of spree drinking.
      \ He was very nervous in the morning after these bouts and quieted himself with
      more liquor.  He was ambitious to succeed in business, but saw that he would
      get nowhere if he drank at all.  Once he started, he had no control whatever.
      \ He made up his mind that until he had been successful in business and had
      retired, he would not touch another drop.  An exceptional man, he remained bone
      dry for twenty-five years and retired at the age of fifty-five, after a successful
      and happy business career.  Then he fell victim to a belief which practically
      every alcoholic has-that his long period of sobriety and self-discipline had
      qualified him to drink as other men.  Out came his carpet slippers and a bottle.
      \ In two months he was in a hospital, puzzled and humiliated.  He tried to regulate
      his drinking for a while, making several trips to the hospital meantime.  Then,
      gathering all his forces, he attempted to stop altogether and found he could
      not.  Every means of solving his problem which  money could buy was at his disposal.
      \ Every attempt failed.  Though a robust man at retirement, he went to pieces
      quickly and was dead within four years.\r\n    This case contains a powerful
      lesson.  Most of us have believed that if we remained sober for a long stretch,
      we could thereafter drink normally.  But here is a man who at fifty-five years
      found he was just where he had left off at thirty.  We have seen the truth demonstrated
      again and again: 'Once an alcoholic, always an alcoholic.'  Commencing to drink
      after a period of sobriety, we are in a short time as bad as ever.  If we are
      planning to stop drinking, there must be no reservation of any kind, nor any
      lurking notion that someday we will be immune to alcohol.\r\n    Young people
      may be encouraged by this man's experience to think that they can stop, as he
      did, on their own will power.  We doubt if many of them can do it, because none
      will really want to stop, and hardly one of them, because of the peculiar mental
      twist already acquired, will find he can win out.  Several of our crowd, men
      of thirty or less, had been drinking only a few years, but they found themselves
      as helpless as those who had been drinking twenty years.\r\n    To be gravely
      affected, one does not necessarily have to drink a long time nor take the quantities
      some of us have.  This is particularly true of women.  Potential female alcoholics
      often turn into the real thing and are gone beyond recall in a few years.  Certain
      drinkers, who would be greatly insulted if called alcoholics, are astonished
      at their inability to stop.  We, who are familiar with the symptoms, see large
      numbers of potential alcoholics among young people everywhere.  But try and
      get them to see it!  \r\n    As we look back, we feel we had gone on drinking
      many years beyond the point where we could quit on our will power.  If anyone
      questions whether he has entered this dangerous area, let him try leaving liquor
      alone for one year.  If he is a real alcoholic and very far advanced, there
      is scant chance of success.  In the early days of our drinking we occasionally
      remained sober for a year or more, becoming serious drinkers again later.  Though
      you may be able to stop for a considerable period, you may yet be a potential
      alcoholic.  We think few, to whom this book will appeal, can stay dry anything
      like a year.  Some will be drunk the day after making their resolutions; most
      of them within a few weeks.\r\n    For those who are unable to drink moderately
      the question is how to stop altogether.  We are assuming, of course, that the
      reader desires to stop.  Whether such a person can quit upon a nonspiritual
      basis depends upon the extent to which he has already lost the power to choose
      whether he will drink or not.  Many of us felt that we had plenty of character.
      \ There was a tremendous urge to cease forever.  Yet we found it impossible.
      \ This is the baffling feature of alcoholism as we know it-this utter inability
      to leave it alone, no matter how great the necessity or the wish.\r\n    How
      then shall we help our readers determine, to their own satisfaction, whether
      they are one of us?  The experiment of quitting for a period of time will be
      helpful, but we think we can render an even greater service to alcoholic sufferers
      and perhaps to the medical  fraternity.  So we shall describe some of the mental
      states that precede a relapse into drinking, for obviously this is the crux
      of the problem.\r\n    What sort of thinking dominates an alcoholic who repeats
      time after time the desperate experiment of the first drink?  Friends who have
      reasoned with him after a spree which has brought him to the point of divorce
      or bankruptcy are mystified when he walks directly into a saloon.  Why does
      he?  Of what is he thinking?\r\n    Our first example is a friend we shall call
      Jim.  This man has a charming wife and family.  He inherited a lucrative automobile
      agency.  He had a commendable World War record.  He is a good salesman.  Everybody
      likes him.  He is an intelligent man, normal so far as we can see, except for
      a nervous disposition.  He did no drinking until he was thirty-five.  In a few
      years he became so violent when intoxicated that he had to be committed.  On
      leaving the asylum he came into contact with us.\r\n    We told him what we
      knew of alcoholism and the answer we had found.  He made a beginning.  His family
      was re-assembled, and he began to work as a salesman for the business he had
      lost through drinking.  All went well for a time, but he failed to enlarge his
      spiritual life.  To his consternation, he found himself drunk half a dozen times
      in rapid succession.  On each of these occasions we worked with him, reviewing
      carefully what had happened.  He agreed he was a real alcoholic and in a serious
      condition.  He knew he faced another trip to the asylum if he kept on.  Moreover,
      he would lose his family for whom he had a deep affection.\r\n    Yet he got
      drunk again.  We asked him to tell us exactly how it happened.  This is his
      story: 'I came to work on Tuesday morning.  I remember I felt irritated that
      I had to be a salesman for a concern I once owned.  I had a few words with the
      boss, but nothing serious.  Then I decided to drive into the country and see
      one of my prospects for a car.  On the way I felt hungry so I stopped at a roadside
      place where they have a bar.  I had no intention of drinking.  I just thought
      I would get a sandwich.  I also had the notion that I might find a customer
      for a car at this place, which was familiar for I had been going to it for years.
      \ I had eaten there many times during the months I was sober.  I sat down at
      a table and ordered a sandwich and a glass of milk.  Still no thought of drinking.
      \ I ordered another sandwich and decided to have another glass of milk.\r\n
      \   'Suddenly the thought crossed my mind that if I were to put an ounce of
      whiskey in my milk it couldn't hurt me on a full stomach.  I ordered a whiskey
      and poured it into the milk.  I vaguely sensed I was not being any too smart,
      but felt reassured as I was taking the whiskey on a full stomach.  The experiment
      went so well that I ordered another whiskey and poured it into more milk.  That
      didn't seem to bother me so I tried another.'\r\n    Thus started one more journey
      to the asylum for Jim.  Here was the threat of commitment, the loss of family
      and position, to say nothing of that intense mental and physical suffering which
      drinking always caused him.  He had much knowledge about himself as an alcoholic.
      \ Yet all reasons for not drinking were easily pushed aside in favor of the
      foolish idea that he could take whiskey if only he mixed it with milk!\r\n    Whatever
      the precise definition of the word may be, we call this plain insanity.  How
      can such a lack of proportion, of the ability to think straight, be called anything
      else?\r\n    You may think this an extreme case.  To us it is not far-fetched,
      for this kind of thinking has been characteristic of every single one of us.
      \ We have sometimes reflected more than Jim did upon the consequences.  But
      there was always the curious mental phenomenon that parallel with our sound
      reasoning there inevitably ran some insanely trivial excuse for taking the first
      drink.  Our sound reasoning failed to hold us in check.  The insane idea won
      out.  Next day we would ask ourselves, in all earnestness and sincerity, how
      it could have happened.\r\n    In some circumstances we have gone out deliberately
      to get drunk, feeling ourselves justified by nervousness, anger, worry, depression,
      jealousy or the like.  But even in this type of beginning we are obliged to
      admit that our justification for a spree was insanely insufficient in the light
      of what always happened.  We now see that when we began to drink deliberately,
      instead of casually, there was little serious or effective thought during the
      period of premeditation of what the terrific consequences might be.\r\n    Our
      behavior is as absurd and incomprehensible with respect to the first drink as
      that of an individual with a passion, say, for jay-walking.  He gets a thrill
      out of skipping in front of fast-moving vehicles.  He enjoys himself for a few
      years in spite of friendly warnings.  Up to this point you would label him as
      a foolish chap having queer ideas of fun.  Luck then deserts him and he is slightly
      injured several times in succession.  You would expect him, if he were normal,
      to cut it out.  Presently he is hit again and this time has a fractured skull.
      \ Within a week after leaving the hospital a fast-moving trolley car breaks
      his arm.  He tells you he has decided to stop jay-walking for good, but in a
      few weeks he breaks both legs.\r\n    On through the years this conduct continues,
      accompanied by his continual promises to be careful or to keep off the streets
      altogether.  Finally, he can no longer work, his wife gets a divorce and he
      is held up to ridicule.  He tries every known means to get the jay-walking idea
      out of his head.  He shuts himself up in an asylum, hoping to mend his ways.
      \ But the day he comes out he races in front of a fire engine, which breaks
      his back.  Such a man would be crazy, wouldn't he?\r\n    You may think our
      illustration is too ridiculous.  But is it?  We, who have been through the wringer,
      have to admit if we substituted alcoholism for jay-walking, the illustration
      would fit us exactly.  However intelligent we may have been in other respects,
      where alcohol has been involved, we have been strangely insane.  It's strong
      language-but isn't it true?\r\n    Some of you are thinking: 'Yes, what you
      tell us is true, but it doesn't fully apply.  We admit we have some of these
      symptoms, but we have not gone to the extremes you fellows did, nor are we likely
      to, for we understand ourselves so well after what you have told us that such
      things cannot happen again.  We have not lost everything in life through drinking
      and we certainly do not intend to.  Thanks for the information.'\r\n    That
      may be true of certain nonalcoholic people who, though drinking foolishly and
      heavily at the present time, are able to stop or moderate, because their brains
      and bodies have not been damaged as ours were.  But the actual or potential
      alcoholic, with hardly an exception, will be absolutely unable to stop drinking
      on the basis of self-knowledge.  This is a point we wish to emphasize and re-emphasize,
      to smash home upon our alcoholic readers as it has been revealed to us out of
      bitter experience.  Let us take another illustration.\r\n    Fred is partner
      in a well known accounting firm.  His income is good, he has a fine home, is
      happily married and the father of promising children of college age.  He has
      so attractive a personality that he makes friends with everyone.  If ever there
      was a successful business man, it is Fred.  To all appearance he is a stable,
      well balanced individual.  Yet, he is alcoholic.  We first saw Fred about a
      year ago in a hospital where he had gone to recover from a bad case of jitters.
      \ It was his first experience of this kind, and he was much ashamed of it.  Far
      from admitting he was an alcoholic, he told himself he came to the hospital
      to rest his nerves.  The doctor intimated strongly that he might be worse than
      he realized.  For a few days he was depressed about his condition.  He made
      up his mind to quit drinking altogether.  It never occurred to him that perhaps
      he could not do so, in spite of his character and standing.  Fred would not
      \ believe himself an alcoholic, much less accept a spiritual remedy for his
      problem.  We told him what we knew about alcoholism.  He was interested and
      conceded that he had some of the symptoms, but he was a long way from admitting
      that he could do nothing about it himself.  He was positive that this humiliating
      experience, plus the knowledge he had acquired, would keep him sober the rest
      of his life.  Self-knowledge would fix it.\r\n    We heard no more of Fred for
      a while. One day we were told that he was back in the hospital.  This time he
      was quite shaky.  He soon indicated he was anxious to see us.  The story he
      told is most instructive, for here was a chap absolutely convinced he had to
      stop drinking, who had no excuse for drinking, who exhibited splendid judgment
      and determination in all his other concerns, yet was flat on his back nevertheless.\r\n
      \   Let him tell you about it: 'I was much impressed with what you fellows said
      about alcoholism, and I frankly did not believe it would be possible for me
      to drink again.  I rather appreciated your ideas about the subtle insanity which
      precedes the first drink, but I was confident it could not happen to me after
      what I had learned.  I reasoned I was not so far advanced as most of you fellows,
      that I had been usually successful in licking my other personal problems, and
      that I would therefore be successful where you men failed. I felt I had every
      right to be self-confident, that it would be only a matter of exercising my
      will power and keeping on guard.\r\n    'In this frame of mind, I went about
      my business and for a time all was well. I had no trouble refusing drinks, and
      began to wonder if I had not been making too hard work of a simple matter.  One
      day I went to Washington to present some accounting evidence to a government
      bureau.  I had been out of town before during this particular dry spell, so
      there was nothing new about that.  Physically, I felt fine.  Neither did I have
      any pressing problems or worries.  My business came off well, I was pleased
      and knew my partners would be too.  It was the end of a perfect day, not a cloud
      on the horizon.\r\n    'I went to my hotel and leisurely dressed for dinner.
      \ As I crossed the threshold of the dining room, the thought came to mind that
      it would be nice to have a couple of cocktails with dinner.  That was all.  Nothing
      more.  I ordered a cocktail and my meal.  Then I ordered another cocktail.  After
      dinner I decided to take a walk.  When I returned to the hotel it struck me
      a highball would be fine before going to bed, so I stepped into the bar and
      had one.  I remember having several more that night and plenty next morning.
      \ I have a shadowy recollection of being in an airplane bound for New York and
      of finding a friendly taxicab driver at the landing field instead of my wife.
      \ The driver escorted me about for several days.  I know little of where I went
      or what I said and did.  Then came the hospital with unbearable mental and physical
      suffering.\r\n    'As soon as I regained my ability to think, I went carefully
      over that evening in Washington.  Not only had I been off guard, I had made
      no fight whatever against the first drink.  This time I had not thought of the
      consequences at all.  I had commenced to drink as carelessly as though the cocktails
      were ginger ale.  I now remembered what my alcoholic friends had told me, how
      they prophesied that if I had an alcoholic mind, the time and place would come-I
      would drink again.  They had said that though I did raise a defense, it would
      one day give way before some trivial reason for having a drink.  Well, just
      that did happen and more, for what I had learned of alcoholism did not occur
      to me at all.  I knew from that moment that I had an alcoholic mind.  I saw
      that will power and self-knowledge would not help in those strange mental blank
      spots.  I had never been able to understand people who said that a problem had
      them hopelessly defeated.  I knew then.  It was a crushing blow.\r\n    'Two
      of the members of Alcoholics Anonymous came to see me. They grinned, which I
      didn't like so much, and then asked me if I thought myself alcoholic and if
      I were really licked this time.  I had to concede both propositions.  They piled
      on me heaps of evidence to the effect that an alcoholic mentality, such as I
      had exhibited in Washington, was a hopeless condition.  They cited cases out
      of their own experience by the dozen.  This process snuffed out the last flicker
      of conviction that I could do the job myself.\r\n    'Then they outlined the
      spiritual answer and program of action which a hundred of them had followed
      successfully. Though I had been only a nominal churchman, their proposals were
      not, intellectually, hard to swallow.  But the program of action, though entirely
      sensible, was pretty drastic.  It meant I would have to throw several lifelong
      conceptions out of the window.  That was not easy.  But the moment I made up
      my mind to go through with the process, I had the curious feeling that my alcoholic
      condition was relieved, as in fact it proved to be.\r\n    'Quite as important
      was the discovery that spiritual principles would solve all my problems.  I
      have since been brought into a way of living infinitely more satisfying and,
      I hope, more useful than the life I lived before.  My old manner of life was
      by no means a bad one, but I would not exchange its best moments for the worst
      I have now.  I would not go back to it even if I could.'\r\n    Fred's story
      speaks for itself.  We hope it strikes home to thousands like him.  He had felt
      only the first nip of the wringer.  Most alcoholics have to be pretty badly
      mangled before they really commence to solve their problems.\r\n    Many doctors
      and psychiatrists agree with our conclusions.  One of these men, staff member
      of a world-renowned hospital, recently made this statement to some of us: 'What
      you say about the general hopelessness of the average alcoholic's plight is,
      in my opinion, correct.  As to two of you men, whose stories I have heard, there
      is no doubt in my mind that you were 100% hopeless, apart from divine help.
      \ Had you offered yourselves as patients at this hospital, I would not have
      taken you, if I had been able to avoid it.  People like you are too heartbreaking.
      \ Though not a religious person, I have profound respect for the spiritual approach
      in such cases as yours.  For most cases, there is virtually no other solution.'\r\n
      \   Once more: The alcoholic at certain times has no effective mental defense
      against the first drink.  Except in a few rare cases, neither he nor any other
      human being can provide such a defense.  His defense must come from a Higher
      Power."

    - WE AGNOSTICS
    - "IN THE PRECEDING chapters you have learned something of alcoholism.  We hope
      we have made clear the distinction between the alcoholic and the nonalcoholic.
      \ If, when you honestly want to, you find you cannot quit entirely, or if when
      drinking, you have little control over the amount you take, you are probably
      alcoholic.  If that be the case, you may be suffering from an illness which
      only a spiritual experience will conquer.\r\n    To one who feels he is an atheist
      or agnostic such an experience seems impossible, but to continue as he is means
      disaster, especially if he is an alcoholic of the hopeless variety.  To be doomed
      to an alcoholic death or to live on a spiritual basis are not always easy alternatives
      to face.\r\n    But it isn't so difficult.  About half our original fellowship
      were of exactly that type.  At first some of us tried to avoid the issue, hoping
      against hope we were not true alcoholics.  But after a while we had to face
      the fact that we must find a spiritual basis of life-or else.  Perhaps it is
      going to be that way with you.  But cheer up, something like half of us thought
      we were atheists or agnostics.  Our experience shows that you need not be disconcerted.\r\n
      \   If a mere code of morals or a better philosophy of life were sufficient
      to overcome alcoholism, many of us would have recovered long ago.  But we found
      that such codes and philosophies did not save us, no matter how much we tried.
      \ We could wish to be moral, we could wish to be philosophically comforted,
      in fact, we could will these things with all our might, but the needed power
      wasn't there.  Our human resources, as marshalled by the will, were not sufficient;
      they failed utterly.\r\n    Lack of power, that was our dilemma.  We had to
      find a power by which we could live, and it had to be a Power greater than ourselves.
      \ Obviously.  But where and how were we to find this Power?\r\n    Well, that's
      exactly what this book is about.  Its main object is to enable you to find a
      Power greater than yourself which will solve your problem.  That means we have
      written a book which we believe to be spiritual as well as moral.  And it means,
      of course, that we are going to talk about God.  Here difficulty arises with
      agnostics.  Many times we talk to a new man and watch his hope rise as we discuss
      his alcoholic problems and explain our fellowship.  But his face falls when
      we speak of spiritual matters, especially when we mention God, for we have re-opened
      a subject which our man thought he had neatly evaded or entirely ignored.\r\n
      \   We know how he feels.  We have shared his honest doubt and prejudice.  Some
      of us have been violently anti-religious.  To others, the word 'God' brought
      up a particular idea of Him with which someone had tried to impress them during
      childhood.  Perhaps we rejected this particular conception because it seemed
      inadequate.  With that rejection we imagined we had abandoned the God idea entirely.
      \ We were bothered with the thought that faith and dependence upon a Power beyond
      ourselves was somewhat weak, even cowardly.  We looked upon this world of warring
      individuals, warring theological systems, and inexplicable calamity, with deep
      skepticism.  We looked askance at many individuals who claimed to be godly.
      \ How could a Supreme Being have anything to do with it all?  And who could
      comprehend a Supreme Being anyhow?  Yet, in other moments, we found ourselves
      thinking, when enchanted by a starlit night, 'Who, then, made all this?'  There
      was a feeling of awe and wonder, but it was fleeting and soon lost.\r\n    Yes,
      we of agnostic temperament have had these thoughts and experiences.  Let us
      make haste to reassure you.  We found that as soon as we were able to lay aside
      prejudice and express even a willingness to believe in a Power greater than
      ourselves, we commenced to get results, even though it was impossible for any
      of us to fully define or comprehend that Power, which is God.\r\n    Much to
      our relief, we discovered we did not need to consider another's conception of
      God.  Our own conception, however inadequate, was sufficient to make the approach
      and to effect a contact with Him.  As soon as we admitted the possible existence
      of a Creative Intelligence, a Spirit of the Universe underlying the totality
      of things, we began to be possessed of a new sense of power and direction, provided
      we took other simple steps.  We found that God does not make too hard terms
      with those who seek Him.  To us, the Realm of Spirit is broad, roomy, all inclusive;
      never exclusive or forbidding to those who earnestly seek.  It is open, we believe,
      to all men.\r\n    When, therefore, we speak to you of God, we mean your own
      conception of God.  This applies, too, to other spiritual expressions which
      you find in this book.  Do not let any prejudice you may have against spiritual
      terms deter you from honestly asking yourself what they mean to you.  At the
      start, this was all we needed to commence spiritual growth, to effect our first
      conscious relation with God as we understood Him.  Afterward, we found ourselves
      accepting many things which then seemed entirely out of reach.  That was growth,
      but if we wished to grow we had to begin somewhere.  So we used our own conception,
      however limited it was.\r\n    We needed to ask ourselves but one short question.
      \ 'Do I now believe, or am I even willing to believe, that there is a Power
      greater than myself ?'  As soon as a man can say that he does believe, or is
      willing to believe, we emphatically assure him that he is on his way.  It has
      been repeatedly proven among us that upon this simple cornerstone a wonderfully
      effective spiritual structure can be built.\r\n    That was great news to us,
      for we had assumed we could not make use of spiritual principles unless we accepted
      many things on faith which seemed difficult to believe.  When people presented
      us with spiritual approaches, how frequently did we all say, 'I wish I had what
      that man has.  I'm sure it would work if I could only believe as he believes.
      \ But I cannot accept as surely true the many articles of faith which are so
      plain to him.'  So it was comforting to learn that we could commence at a simpler
      level.\r\n    Besides a seeming inability to accept much on faith, we often
      found ourselves handicapped by obstinacy,  sensitiveness, and unreasoning prejudice.
      \ Many of us have been so touchy that even casual reference to spiritual things
      made us bristle with antagonism.  This sort of thinking had to be abandoned.
      \ Though some of us resisted, we found no great difficulty in casting aside
      such feelings.  Faced with alcoholic destruction, we soon became as open minded
      on spiritual matters as we had tried to be on other questions.  In this respect
      alcohol was a great persuader.  It finally beat us into a state of reasonableness.
      \ Sometimes this was a tedious process; we hope no one else will be prejudiced
      for as long as some of us were.\r\n    The reader may still ask why he should
      believe in a Power greater than himself.  We think there are good reasons.  Let
      us have a look at some of them.\r\n    The practical individual of today is
      a stickler for facts and results.  Nevertheless, the twentieth century readily
      accepts theories of all kinds, provided they are firmly grounded in fact.  We
      have numerous theories, for example, about electricity.  Everybody believes
      them without a murmur of doubt.  Why this ready acceptance?  Simply because
      it is impossible to explain what we see, feel, direct, and use, without a reasonable
      assumption as a starting point.\r\n    Everybody nowadays, believes in scores
      of assumptions for which there is good evidence, but no perfect visual proof.
      \ And does not science demonstrate that  visual proof is the weakest proof?
      \ It is being constantly revealed, as mankind studies the material world, that
      outward appearances are not inward reality at all.  To illustrate:\r\n    The
      prosaic steel girder is a mass of electrons whirling around each other at incredible
      speed.  These tiny bodies are governed by precise laws, and these laws hold
      true throughout the material world.  Science tells us so.  We have no reason
      to doubt it.  When, however, the perfectly logical assumption is suggested that
      underneath the material world and life as we see it, there is an All Powerful,
      Guiding, Creative Intelligence, right there our perverse streak comes to the
      surface and we laboriously set out to convince ourselves it isn't so.  We read
      wordy books and indulge in windy arguments, thinking we  believe this universe
      needs no God to explain it.  Were our contentions true, it would follow that
      life originated out of nothing, means nothing, and proceeds nowhere.\r\n    Instead
      of regarding ourselves as intelligent agents, spearheads of God's ever advancing
      Creation, we agnostics and atheists chose to believe that our human intelligence
      was the last word, the alpha and the omega, the beginning and end of all.  Rather
      vain of us, wasn't it?\r\n    We, who have traveled this dubious path, beg you
      to lay aside prejudice, even against organized religion.  We have learned that
      whatever the human frailties of various faiths may be, those faiths have given
      purpose and direction to millions.  People of faith have a logical idea of what
      life is all about.  Actually, we used to have no reasonable conception whatever.
      \ We used to amuse ourselves by cynically dissecting spiritual beliefs and practices
      when we might have observed that many spiritually-minded persons of all races,
      colors, and creeds were demonstrating a degree of stability, happiness and usefulness
      which we should have sought ourselves.\r\n    Instead, we looked at the human
      defects of these people, and sometimes used their shortcomings as a basis of
      wholesale condemnation.  We talked of intolerance, while we were intolerant
      ourselves.  We missed the reality and the beauty of the forest because we were
      diverted by the ugliness of some of its trees.  We never gave the spiritual
      side of life a fair hearing.\r\n    In our personal stories you will find a
      wide variation in the way each teller approaches and conceives of the Power
      which is greater than himself.  Whether we agree with a particular approach
      or conception seems to make little difference.  Experience has taught us that
      these are matters about which, for our purpose, we need not be worried.  They
      are questions for each individual to settle for himself.\r\n    On one proposition,
      however, these men and women are strikingly agreed.  Every one of them has gained
      access to, and believes in, a Power greater than himself.  This Power has in
      each case accomplished the miraculous, the humanly impossible.  As a celebrated
      American statesman put it, 'Let's look at the record.'\r\n    Here are thousands
      of men and women, worldly indeed.  They flatly declare that since they have
      come  to believe in a Power greater than themselves, to take a certain attitude
      toward that Power, and to do certain simple things, there has been a revolutionary
      change in their way of living and thinking.  In the face of collapse and despair,
      in the face of the total failure of their human resources, they found that a
      new power, peace, happiness, and sense of direction flowed into them. This happened
      soon after they wholeheartedly met a few simple requirements.  Once confused
      and baffled by the seeming futility of existence, they show the underlying reasons
      why they were making heavy going of life.  Leaving aside the drink question,
      they tell why living was so unsatisfactory.  They show how the change came over
      them.  When many hundreds of people are able to say that the consciousness of
      the Presence of God is today the most important fact of their lives, they present
      a powerful reason why one should have faith.\r\n    This world of ours has made
      more material progress in the last century than in all the millenniums which
      went before.  Almost everyone knows the reason.  Students of ancient history
      tell us that the intellect of men in those days was equal to the best of today.
      \ Yet in ancient times material progress was painfully slow.  The spirit of
      modern scientific inquiry, research and invention was almost unknown.  In the
      realm of the material, men's minds were fettered by superstition, tradition,
      and all sorts of fixed ideas.  Some of the contemporaries of Columbus thought
      a round earth preposterous.  Others came near putting Galileo to death for his
      astronomical heresies.\r\n    We asked ourselves this: Are not some of us just
      as biased and unreasonable about the realm of the spirit as were the ancients
      about the realm of the material?  Even in the present century, American newspapers
      were afraid to print an account of the Wright brothers' first successful flight
      at Kitty Hawk.  Had not all efforts at flight failed before?  Did not Professor
      Langley's flying machine go to the bottom of the Potomac River?  Was it not
      true that the best mathematical minds had proved man could never fly?  Had not
      people said God had reserved this privilege to the birds?  Only thirty years
      later the conquest of the air was almost an old story and airplane travel was
      in full swing.\r\n    But in most fields our generation has witnessed complete
      liberation of our thinking.  Show any longshoreman a Sunday supplement describing
      a proposal to explore the moon by means of a rocket and he will say 'I bet they
      do it - maybe not so long either.'  Is not our age characterized by the ease
      with which we discard old ideas for new, by the complete readiness with which
      we throw away the theory or gadget which does not work for something new which
      does?\r\n    We had to ask ourselves why we shouldn't apply to our human problems
      this same readiness to change our point of view.  We were having trouble with
      personal relationships, we couldn't control our emotional natures, we were a
      prey to misery and depression, we couldn't make a living, we had a feeling of
      uselessness, we were full of fear, we were unhappy, we couldn't seem to be of
      real help to other people - was not a basic solution of these bedevilments more
      important than whether we should see newsreels of lunar flight?  Of course it
      was.\r\n    When we saw others solve their problems by a simple reliance upon
      the Spirit of the Universe, we had to stop doubting the power of God.  Our ideas
      did not work.  But the God idea did.\r\n    The Wright brothers' almost childish
      faith that they could build a machine which would fly was the main- spring of
      their accomplishment.  Without that, nothing could have happened.  We agnostics
      and atheists were sticking to the idea that self-sufficiency would solve our
      problems.  When others showed us that 'God-sufficiency' worked with them, we
      began to feel like those who had insisted the Wrights would never fly.\r\n    Logic
      is great stuff.  We liked it.  We still like it.  It is not by chance we were
      given the power to reason, to examine the evidence of our senses, and to draw
      conclusions.  That is one of man's magnificent attributes.  We agnostically
      inclined would not feel satisfied with a proposal which does not lend itself
      to reasonable approach and interpretation.  Hence we are at pains to tell why
      we think our present faith is reasonable, why we think it more sane and logical
      to believe than not to believe, why we say our former thinking was soft and
      mushy when we threw up our hands in doubt and said, 'We don't know.'\r\n    When
      we became alcoholics, crushed by a self-imposed crisis we could not postpone
      or evade, we had to fearlessly face the proposition that either God is everything
      or else He is nothing.  God either is, or He isn't.  What was our choice to
      be?\r\n    Arrived at this point, we were squarely confronted with the question
      of faith.  We couldn't duck the issue.  Some of us had already walked far over
      the Bridge of Reason toward the desired shore of faith. The outlines and the
      promise of the New Land had brought lustre to tired eyes and fresh courage to
      flagging spirits.  Friendly hands had stretched out in welcome.  We were grateful
      that Reason had brought us so far.  But somehow, we couldn't quite step ashore.
      \ Perhaps we had been leaning too heavily on Reason that last mile and we did
      not like to lose our support.\r\n    That was natural, but let us think a little
      more closely.  Without knowing it, had we not been brought to where we stood
      by a certain kind of faith?  For did we not believe in our own reasoning?  Did
      we not have confidence in our ability to think?  What was that but a sort of
      faith?  Yes, we had been faithful, abjectly faithful to the God of Reason.  So,
      in one way or another, we discovered that faith had been involved all the time!\r\n
      \   We found, too, that we had been worshippers.  What a state of mental goose-flesh
      that used to bring on!  Had we not variously worshipped people, sentiment, things,
      money, and ourselves?  And then, with a better motive, had we not worshipfully
      beheld the sunset, the sea, or a flower?  Who of us had not loved something
      or somebody?  How much did these feelings, these loves, these worships, have
      to do with pure reason?  Little or nothing, we saw at last.  Were not these
      things the tissue out of which our lives were constructed?  Did not these feelings,
      after all, determine the course of our existence?  It was impossible to say
      we had no capacity for faith, or love, or worship.  In one form or another we
      had been living by faith and little else.\r\n    Imagine life without faith!
      \ Were nothing left but pure reason, it wouldn't be life.  But we believed in
      life - of course we did.  We could not prove life in the sense that you can
      prove a straight line is the shortest distance between two points, yet, there
      it was.  Could we still say the whole thing was nothing but a mass of electrons,
      created out of nothing, meaning nothing, whirling on to a destiny of nothingness?
      \ Of course we couldn't.  The electrons themselves seemed more intelligent than
      that.  At least, so the chemist said.\r\n    Hence, we saw that reason isn't
      everything.  Neither is reason, as most of us use it, entirely dependable, though
      it emanate from our best minds.  What about people who proved that man could
      never fly?\r\n    Yet we had been seeing another kind of flight, a spiritual
      liberation from this world, people who rose above their problems.  They said
      God made these things possible, and we only smiled.  We had seen spiritual release,
      but liked to tell ourselves it wasn't true.\r\n    Actually we were fooling
      ourselves, for deep down in every man, woman, and child, is the fundamental
      idea of God.  It may be obscured by calamity, by pomp, by worship of other things,
      but in some form or other it is there.  For faith in a Power greater than ourselves,
      and miraculous demonstrations of that power in human lives, are facts as old
      as man himself.\r\n    We finally saw that faith in some kind of God was a part
      of our make-up, just as much as the feeling we have for a friend.  Sometimes
      we had to search fearlessly, but He was there.  He was as much a fact as we
      were.  We found the Great Reality deep down within us.  In the last analysis
      it is only there that He may be found.  It was so with us.\r\n    We can only
      clear the ground a bit.  If our testimony helps sweep away prejudice, enables
      you to think honestly, encourages you to search diligently within yourself,
      then, if you wish, you can join us on the Broad Highway.  With this attitude
      you cannot fail.  The consciousness of your belief is sure to come to you.\r\n
      \   In this book you will read the experience of a man who thought he was an
      atheist.  His story is so interesting that some of it should be told now.  His
      change of heart was dramatic, convincing, and moving.\r\n    Our friend was
      a minister's son.  He attended church school, where he became rebellious at
      what he thought an overdose of religious education.  For years thereafter he
      was dogged by trouble and frustration.  Business failure, insanity, fatal illness,
      suicide - these calamities in his immediate family embittered and depressed
      him.  Post-war disillusionment, ever more serious alcoholism, impending mental
      and physical collapse, brought him to the point of self-destruction.\r\n    One
      night, when confined in a hospital, he was approached by an alcoholic who had
      known a spiritual experience.  Our friend's gorge rose as he bitterly cried
      out: 'If there is a God, He certainly hasn't done anything for me!'  But later,
      alone in his room, he asked himself this question: 'Is it possible that all
      the religious people I have known are wrong?'  While pondering the answer he
      felt as though he lived in hell.  Then, like a thunderbolt, a great thought
      came.  It crowded out all else:\r\n    'Who are you to say there is no God?'\r\n
      \   This man recounts that he tumbled out of bed to his knees.  In a few seconds
      he was overwhelmed by a conviction of the Presence of God.  It poured over and
      through him with the certainty and majesty of a great tide at flood.  The barriers
      he had built through the years were swept away.  He stood in the Presence of
      Infinite Power and Love.  He had stepped from bridge to shore.  For the first
      time, he lived in conscious companionship with his Creator.\r\n    Thus was
      our friend's cornerstone fixed in place.  No later vicissitude has shaken it.
      \ His alcoholic problem was taken away.  That very night, years ago, it disappeared.
      \ Save for a few brief moments of temptation the thought of drink has never
      returned; and at such times a great revulsion has risen up in him.  Seemingly
      he could not drink even if he would.  God had restored his sanity.\r\n    What
      is this but a miracle of healing?  Yet its elements are simple.  Circumstances
      made him willing to believe.  He humbly offered himself to his Maker - then
      he knew.\r\n    Even so has God restored us all to our right minds.  To this
      man, the revelation was sudden.  Some of us grow into it more slowly.  But He
      has come to all who have honestly sought Him.\r\n    When we drew near to Him
      He disclosed Himself to us!"

    - HOW IT WORKS
    - "RARELY HAVE we seen a person fail who has thoroughly followed our path.  Those
      who do not recover are people who cannot or will not completely give themselves
      to this simple program, usually men and women who are constitutionally incapable
      of being honest with themselves.  There are such unfortunates.  They are not
      at fault; they seem to have been born that way.  They are naturally incapable
      of grasping and developing a manner of living which demands rigorous honesty.
      \ Their chances are less than average.  There are those, too, who suffer from
      grave emotional and mental disorders, but many of them do recover if they have
      the capacity to be honest.\r\n    Our stories disclose in a general way what
      we used to be like, what happened, and what we are like now. If you have decided
      you want what we have and are willing to go to any length to get it-then you
      are ready to take certain steps.\r\n    At some of these we balked.  We thought
      we could find an easier, softer way.  But we could not.  With all the earnestness
      at our command, we beg of you to be fearless and thorough from the very start.
      \ Some of us have tried to hold on to our old ideas and the result was nil until
      we let go absolutely.\r\n    Remember that we deal with alcohol - cunning, baffling,
      powerful!  Without help it is too much for us.  But there is One who has all
      power-that One is God.  May you find Him now!\r\n    Half measures availed us
      nothing.  We stood at the turning point.  We asked His protection and care with
      complete abandon.\r\n    Here are the steps we took, which are suggested as
      a program of recovery:\r\n    1. We admitted we were powerless over alcohol
      - that our lives had become unmanageable.\r\n    2. Came to believe that a Power
      greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.\r\n    3. Made a decision
      to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understood Him.\r\n
      \   4. Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.\r\n    5.
      Admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of
      our wrongs.\r\n    6. Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects
      of character.\r\n    7. Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings.\r\n    8.
      Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends
      to them all.\r\n    9. Made direct amends to such people wherever possible,
      except when to do so would injure them or others.\r\n    10. Continued to take
      personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it.\r\n    11. Sought
      through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God as we
      understood Him, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power
      to carry that out.\r\n    12. Having had a spiritual awakening as the result
      of these steps, we tried to carry this message to alcoholics, and to practice
      these principles in all our affairs.\r\n    Many of us exclaimed, 'What an order!
      I can't go through with it.'  Do not be discouraged.  No one among us has been
      able to maintain anything like perfect adherence to these principles.  We are
      not saints.  The point is, that we are willing to grow along spiritual lines.
      \ The principles we have set down are guides to progress.  We claim spiritual
      progress rather than spiritual perfection.\r\n    Our description of the alcoholic,
      the chapter to the agnostic, and our personal adventures before and after make
      clear three pertinent ideas:\r\n    (a) That we were alcoholic and could not
      manage our own lives.\r\n    (b) That probably no human power could have relieved
      our alcoholism.\r\n    (c) That God could and would if He were sought.\r\n    Being
      convinced, we were at Step Three, which is that we decided to turn our will
      and our life over to God as we understood Him.  Just what do we mean by that,
      and just what do we do?\r\n    The first requirement is that we be convinced
      that any life run on self-will can hardly be a success.  On that basis we are
      almost always in collision with something or somebody, even though our motives
      are good.  Most people try to live by self-propulsion.  Each person is like
      an actor who wants to run the whole show; is forever trying to arrange the lights,
      the ballet, the scenery and the rest of the players in his own way.  If his
      arrangements would only stay put, if only people would do as he wished, the
      show would be great.  Everybody, including himself, would be pleased. Life would
      be wonderful.  In trying to make these arrangements our actor may sometimes
      be quite virtuous.  He may be kind, considerate, patient, generous; even modest
      and self-sacrificing.  On the other hand, he may be mean, egotistical, selfish
      and dishonest.  But, as with most humans, he is more likely to have varied traits.\r\n
      \   What usually happens?  The show doesn't come off very well.  He begins to
      think life doesn't treat him right.  He decides to exert himself more.  He becomes,
      on the next occasion, still more demanding or gracious, as the case may be.
      \ Still the play does not suit him.  Admitting he may be somewhat at fault,
      he is sure that other people are more to blame. He becomes angry, indignant,
      self-pitying.  What is his basic trouble?  Is he not really a self-seeker even
      when trying to be kind?  Is he not a victim of the delusion that he can wrest
      satisfaction and happiness out of this world if he only manages well?  Is it
      not evident to all the rest of the players that these are the things he wants?
      \ And do not his actions make each of them wish to retaliate, snatching all
      they can get out of the show?  Is he not, even in his best moments, a producer
      of confusion rather than harmony?\r\n    Our actor is self-centered-ego-centric,
      as people like to call it nowadays.  He is like the retired business man who
      lolls in the Florida sunshine in the winter complaining of the sad state of
      the nation; the minister who sighs over the sins of the twentieth century; politicians
      and reformers who are sure all would be Utopia if the rest of the world would
      only behave; the outlaw safe cracker who thinks society has wronged him; and
      the alcoholic who has lost all and is locked up.  Whatever our protestations,
      are not most of us concerned with ourselves, our resentments, or our self-pity?\r\n
      \   Selfishness-self-centeredness!  That, we think, is the root of our troubles.
      \ Driven by a hundred forms of fear, self-delusion, self-seeking, and self-pity,
      we step on the toes of our fellows and they retaliate.  Sometimes they hurt
      us, seemingly without provocation, but we invariably find that at some time
      in the past we have made decisions based on self which later placed us in a
      position to be hurt.\r\n    So our troubles, we think, are basically of our
      own making.  They arise out of ourselves, and the alcoholic is an extreme example
      of self-will run riot, though he usually doesn't think so.  Above everything,
      we alcoholics must be rid of this selfishness.  We must, or it kills us!  God
      makes that possible.  And there often seems no way of entirely getting rid of
      self without His aid.  Many of us had moral and philosophical convictions galore,
      but we could not live up to them even though we would have liked to.  Neither
      could we reduce our self-centeredness much by wishing or trying on our own power.
      \ We had to have God's help.\r\n    This is the how and why of it.  First of
      all, we had to quit playing God.  It didn't work.  Next, we decided that hereafter
      in this drama of life, God was going to be our Director.  He is the Principal;
      we are His agents.  He is the Father, and we are His children.  Most good ideas
      are simple, and this concept was the keystone of the new and triumphant arch
      through which we passed to freedom.\r\n    When we sincerely took such a position,
      all sorts of remarkable things followed.  We had a new Employer.  Being all
      powerful, He provided what we needed, if we kept close to Him and performed
      His work well.  Established on such a footing we became less and less interested
      in ourselves, our little plans and designs.  More and more we became interested
      in seeing what we could contribute to life.  As we felt new power flow in, as
      we enjoyed peace of mind, as we discovered we could face life successfully,
      as we became conscious of His presence, we began to lose our fear of today,
      tomorrow or the hereafter.  We were reborn.\r\n    We were now at Step Three.
      \ Many of us said to our Maker, as we understood Him: 'God, I offer myself to
      Thee-to build with me and to do with me as Thou wilt.  Relieve me of the bondage
      of self, that I may better do Thy will.  Take away my difficulties, that victory
      over them may bear witness to those I would help of Thy Power, Thy Love, and
      Thy Way of life.  May I do Thy will always!'  We thought well before taking
      this step making sure we were ready; that we could at last abandon ourselves
      utterly to Him.\r\n    We found it very desirable to take this spiritual step
      with an understanding person, such as our wife, best friend or spiritual adviser.
      \ But it is better to meet God alone than with one who might misunderstand.
      \ The wording was, of course, quite optional so long as we expressed the idea,
      voicing it without reservation.  This was only a beginning, though if honestly
      and humbly made, an effect, sometimes a very great one, was felt at once.\r\n
      \   Next we launched out on a course of vigorous action, the first step of which
      is a personal housecleaning, which many of us had never attempted.  Though our
      \ decision was a vital and crucial step, it could have little permanent effect
      unless at once followed by a strenuous effort to face, and to be rid of, the
      things in ourselves which had been blocking us.  Our liquor was but a symptom.
      \ So we had to get down to causes and conditions.\r\n    Therefore, we started
      upon a personal inventory.  This was Step Four.  A business which takes no regular
      inventory usually goes broke.  Taking a commercial  inventory is a fact-finding
      and a fact-facing process.  It is an effort to discover the truth about the
      stock-in-trade.  One object is to disclose damaged or unsalable goods, to get
      rid of them promptly and without regret.  If the owner of the business is to
      be successful, he cannot fool himself about values.\r\n    We did exactly the
      same thing with our lives.  We took stock honestly.  First, we searched out
      the flaws in our make-up which caused our failure.  Being convinced that self,
      manifested in various ways, was what had defeated us, we considered its common
      manifestations.\r\n    Resentment is the 'number one' offender.  It destroys
      more alcoholics than anything else.  From it stem all forms of spiritual disease,
      for we have been not only mentally and physically ill, we have been spiritually
      sick.  When the spiritual malady is overcome, we straighten out mentally and
      physically.  In dealing with resentments, we set them on paper.  We listed people,
      institutions or principles with whom we were angry.  We asked ourselves why
      we were angry.  In most cases it was found that our self-esteem, our pocketbooks,
      our ambitions, our personal relationships (including sex) were hurt or threatened.
      \ So we were sore.  We were 'burned up.'\r\n    On our grudge list we set opposite
      each name our  injuries.  Was it our self-esteem, our security, our ambitions,
      our personal, or sex relations, which had been  interfered with?\r\n    We were
      usually as definite as this example:\r\n    \r\n    I'm resentful at:            The
      Cause                                    Affects my:\r\n    \r\n    Mr. Brown

      house put in  Security (fear)\r\n        her name.\r\n    \r\n    We went back
      through our lives.  Nothing counted but thoroughness and honesty.  When we were
      finished we considered it carefully.  The first thing apparent was that this
      world and its people were often quite wrong.  To conclude that others were wrong
      was as far as most of us ever got.  The usual outcome was that people continued
      to wrong us and we stayed sore.  Sometimes it was remorse and then we were sore
      at ourselves.  But the more we fought and tried to have our own way, the worse
      matters got.  As in war, the victor only seemed to win.  Our moments of triumph
      were short-lived.\r\n    It is plain that a life which includes deep resentment
      leads only to futility and unhappiness.  To the precise extent that we permit
      these, do we squander the hours that might have been worth while.  But with
      the alcoholic, whose hope is the maintenance and growth of a spiritual experience,
      this business of resentment is infinitely grave.  We found that it is fatal.
      \ For when harboring such feelings we shut ourselves off from the sunlight of
      the Spirit.  The insanity of alcohol returns and we drink again.  And with us,
      to drink is to die.\r\n    If we were to live, we had to be free of anger.  The
      grouch and the brainstorm were not for us.  They may be the dubious luxury of
      normal men, but for alcoholics these things are poison.\r\n    We turned back
      to the list, for it held the key to the future.  We were prepared to look at
      it from an entirely different angle.  We began to see that the world and its
      people really dominated us.  In that state, the wrong-doing of others, fancied
      or real, had power to actually kill.  How could we escape?  We saw that these
      resentments must be mastered, but how?  We could not wish them away any more
      than alcohol.\r\n    This was our course:  We realized that the people who wronged
      us were perhaps spiritually sick. Though we did not like their symptoms and
      the way these disturbed us, they, like ourselves, were sick too.  We asked God
      to help us show them the same tolerance, pity, and patience that we would cheerfully
      grant a sick friend.  When a person offended we said to ourselves, 'This is
      a sick man.  How can I be helpful to him?  God save me from being angry.  Thy
      will be done.'\r\n    We avoid retaliation or argument.  We wouldn't treat sick
      people that way.  If we do, we destroy our chance of being helpful.  We cannot
      be helpful to all people, but at least God will show us how to take a kindly
      and tolerant view of each and every one.\r\n    Referring to our list again.
      \ Putting out of our minds the wrongs others had done, we resolutely looked
      for our own mistakes.  Where had we been selfish, dishonest, self-seeking and
      frightened?  Though a situation had not been entirely our fault, we tried to
      disregard the other person involved entirely.  Where were we to blame?  The
      inventory was ours, not the other man's.  When we saw our faults we listed them.
      \ We placed them before us in black and white.  We admitted our wrongs honestly
      and were willing to set these matters straight.\r\n    Notice that the word
      'fear' is bracketed alongside the difficulties with Mr. Brown, Mrs. Jones, the
      employer, and the wife.  This short word somehow touches about every aspect
      of our lives.  It was an evil and corroding thread; the fabric of our existence
      was shot through with it.  It set in motion trains of circumstances which brought
      us misfortune we felt we didn't deserve.  But did not we, ourselves, set the
      ball rolling?  Sometimes we think fear ought to be classed with stealing.  It
      seems to cause more trouble.\r\n    We reviewed our fears thoroughly.  We put
      them on paper, even though we had no resentment in connection with them.  We
      asked ourselves why we had them.  Wasn't it because self-reliance failed us?
      \ Self-reliance was good as far as it went, but it didn't go far enough.  Some
      of us once had great self-confidence, but it didn't fully solve the fear problem,
      or any other.  When it made us cocky, it was worse.\r\n    Perhaps there is
      a better way-we think so.  For we are now on a different basis; the basis of
      trusting and relying upon God.  We trust infinite God rather than our finite
      selves.  We are in the world to play the role He assigns.  Just to the extent
      that we do as we think He would have us, and humbly rely on Him, does He enable
      us to match calamity with serenity.\r\n    We never apologize to anyone for
      depending upon our Creator.  We can laugh at those who think spirituality the
      way of weakness.  Paradoxically, it is the way of strength.  The verdict of
      the ages is that faith means courage.  All men of faith have courage.  They
      trust their God.  We never apologize for God.  Instead we let Him demonstrate,
      through us, what He can do.  We ask Him to remove our fear and direct our attention
      to what He would have us be.  At once, we commence to outgrow fear.\r\n    Now
      about sex.  Many of us needed an overhauling there.  But above all, we tried
      to be sensible on this question.  It's so easy to get way off the track.  Here
      we find human opinions running to extremes-absurd extremes, perhaps.  One set
      of voices cry that sex is a lust of our lower nature, a base necessity of procreation.
      \ Then we have the voices who cry for sex and more sex; who bewail the institution
      of marriage; who think that most of the troubles of the race are traceable to
      sex causes.  They think we do not have enough of it, or that it isn't the right
      kind.  They see its significance everywhere.  One school would allow man no
      flavor for his fare and the other would have us all on a straight pepper diet.
      \ We want to stay out of this controversy.  We do not want to be the arbiter
      of anyone's sex conduct.  We all have sex problems.  We'd hardly be human if
      we didn't.  What can we do about them?\r\n    We reviewed our own conduct over
      the years past.  Where had we been selfish, dishonest, or inconsiderate?  Whom
      had we hurt?  Did we unjustifiably arouse jealousy, suspicion or bitterness?
      \ Where were we at fault, what should we have done instead?  We got this all
      down on paper and looked at it.\r\n    In this way we tried to shape a sane
      and sound ideal for our future sex life.  We subjected each relation to this
      test-was it selfish or not?  We asked God to mold our ideals and help us to
      live up to them.  We remembered always that our sex powers were God-given and
      therefore good, neither to be used lightly or selfishly nor to be despised and
      loathed.\r\n    Whatever our ideal turns out to be, we must be willing to grow
      toward it.  We must be willing to make amends where we have done harm,  provided
      that we do not bring about still more harm in so doing.  In other words, we
      treat sex as we would any other problem.  In meditation, we ask God what we
      should do about each specific matter.  The right answer will come, if we want
      it.\r\n    God alone can judge our sex situation.  Counsel with persons is often
      desirable, but we let God be the final judge.  We realize that some people are
      as fanatical about sex as others are loose.  We avoid hysterical thinking or
      advice.\r\n    Suppose we fall short of the chosen ideal and stumble?  Does
      this mean we are going to get drunk?  Some people tell us so.  But this is only
      a half-truth.  It depends on us and on our motives.  If we are sorry for what
      we have done, and have the honest desire to let God take us to better things,
      we believe we will be forgiven and will have learned our lesson.  If we are
      not sorry, and our conduct continues to harm others, we are quite sure to drink.
      \ We are not theorizing.  These are facts out of our experience.\r\n    To sum
      up about sex:  We earnestly pray for the right ideal, for guidance in each questionable
      situation, for sanity, and for the strength to do the right thing.  If sex is
      very troublesome, we throw ourselves the harder into helping others.  We think
      of their needs and work for them.  This takes us out of ourselves.  It quiets
      the imperious urge, when to yield would mean heartache.\r\n    If we have been
      thorough about our personal inventory, we have written down a lot.  We have
      listed and analyzed our resentments.  We have begun to comprehend their futility
      and their fatality.  We have commenced to see their terrible destructiveness.
      \ We have begun to learn tolerance, patience and good will toward all men, even
      our enemies, for we look on them as sick people.  We have listed the people
      we have hurt by our conduct, and are willing to straighten out the past if we
      can.\r\n    In this book you read again and again that faith did for us what
      we could not do for ourselves.  We hope you are convinced now that God can remove
      whatever self-will has blocked you off from Him.  If you have already made a
      decision, and an inventory of your grosser handicaps, you have made a good beginning.
      \ That being so you have swallowed and digested some big chunks of truth about
      yourself."
    - '5'

    - INTO ACTION
    - "HAVING MADE our personal inventory, what shall we do about it?  We have been
      trying to get a new attitude, a new relationship with our Creator, and to discover
      the obstacles in our path.  We have admitted certain defects; we have ascertained
      in a rough way what the trouble is; we have put our finger on the weak items
      in our personal inventory.  Now these are about to be cast out.  This requires
      action on our part, which, when completed, will mean that we have admitted to
      God, to ourselves, and to another human being, the exact nature of our defects.
      \ This brings us to the Fifth Step in the program of recovery mentioned in the
      preceding chapter.\r\n    This is perhaps difficult-especially discussing our
      defects with another person.  We think we have done well enough in admitting
      these things to ourselves.  There is doubt about that.  In actual practice,
      we usually find a solitary self-appraisal insufficient.  Many of us thought
      it necessary to go much further.  We will be more reconciled to discussing ourselves
      with another person when we see good reasons why we should do so.  The best
      reason first: If we skip this vital step, we may not overcome drinking.  Time
      after time newcomers have tried to keep to themselves certain facts about their
      lives.  Trying to avoid this humbling experience, they have turned to easier
      methods.  Almost invariably they got drunk.  Having persevered with the rest
      of the program, they wondered why they fell.  We think the reason is that they
      never completed their housecleaning.  They took inventory all right, but hung
      on to some of the worst items in stock.  They only thought they had lost their
      egoism and fear; they only thought they had humbled themselves.  But they had
      not learned enough of humility, fearlessness and honesty, in the sense we find
      it necessary, until they told someone else all their life story.\r\n    More
      than most people, the alcoholic leads a double life.  He is very much the actor.
      \ To the outer world he presents his stage character.  This is the one he likes
      his fellows to see.  He wants to enjoy a certain reputation, but knows in his
      heart he doesn't deserve it.\r\n    The inconsistency is made worse by the things
      he does on his sprees.  Coming to his senses, he is revolted at certain episodes
      he vaguely remembers.  These memories are a nightmare.  He trembles to think
      someone might have observed him.  As fast as he can, he pushes these memories
      far inside himself.  He hopes they will never see the light of day.  He is under
      constant fear and tension-that makes for more drinking.\r\n    Psychologists
      are inclined to agree with us.  We have spent thousands of dollars for examinations.
      \ We know but few instances where we have given these doctors a fair break.
      \ We have seldom told them the whole truth nor have we followed their advice.
      \ Unwilling to be honest with these sympathetic men, we were honest with no
      one else.  Small wonder many in the medical profession have a low opinion of
      alcoholics and their chance for recovery!\r\n    We must be entirely honest
      with somebody if we expect to live long or happily in this world.  Rightly and
      naturally, we think well before we choose the person or persons with whom to
      take this intimate and confidential step.  Those of us belonging to a religious
      denomination which requires confession must, and of course, will want to go
      to the properly appointed authority whose duty it is to receive it.  Though
      we have no religious connection, we may still do well to talk with someone ordained
      by an established religion.  We often find such a person quick to see and understand
      our problem.  Of course, we sometimes encounter people who do not understand
      alcoholics.\r\n    If we cannot or would rather not do this, we search our acquaintance
      for a close-mouthed, understanding friend.  Perhaps our doctor or psychologist
      will be the person.  It may be one of our own family, but we cannot disclose
      anything to our wives or our parents which will hurt them and make them unhappy.
      \ We have no right to save our own skin at another person's expense.  Such parts
      of our story we tell to someone who will understand, yet be unaffected.  The
      rule is we must be hard on ourself, but always considerate of others.\r\n    Notwithstanding
      the great necessity for discussing ourselves with someone, it may be one is
      so situated that there is no suitable person available.  If that is so, this
      step may be postponed, only, however, if we hold ourselves in complete readiness
      to go through with it at the first opportunity.  We say this because we are
      very anxious that we talk to the right person.  It is important that he be able
      to keep a confidence; that he fully understand and approve what we are driving
      at; that he will not try to change our plan.  But we must not use this as a
      mere excuse to postpone.\r\n    When we decide who is to hear our story, we
      waste no time.  We have a written inventory and we are prepared for a long talk.
      \ We explain to our partner what we are about to do and why we have to do it.
      \ He should realize that we are engaged upon a life-and-death errand.  Most
      people approached in this way will be glad to help; they will be honored by
      our confidence.\r\n    We pocket our pride and go to it, illuminating every
      twist of character, every dark cranny of the past.  Once we have taken this
      step, withholding nothing, we are delighted.  We can look the world in the eye.
      \ We can be alone at perfect peace and ease.  Our fears fall from us.  We begin
      to feel the nearness of our Creator.  We may have had certain spiritual beliefs,
      but now we begin to have a spiritual experience.  The feeling that the drink
      problem has disappeared will often come strongly.  We feel we are on the Broad
      Highway, walking hand in hand with the Spirit of the Universe.\r\n    Returning
      home we find a place where we can be quiet for an hour, carefully reviewing
      what we have done.  We thank God from the bottom of our heart that we know Him
      better.  Taking this book down from our shelf we turn to the page which contains
      the twelve steps.  Carefully reading the first five proposals we ask if we have
      omitted anything, for we are building an arch through which we shall walk a
      free man at last.  Is our work solid so far?  Are the stones properly in place?
      \ Have we skimped on the cement put into the foundation?  Have we tried to make
      mortar without sand?\r\n    If we can answer to our satisfaction, we then look
      at Step Six.  We have emphasized willingness as being indispensable.  Are we
      now ready to let God remove from us all the things which we have admitted are
      objectionable?  Can He now take them all-every one?  If we still cling to something
      we will not let go, we ask God to help us be willing.\r\n    When ready, we
      say something like this: 'My Creator, I am now willing that you should have
      all of me, good and bad.  I pray that you now remove from me every single defect
      of character which stands in the way of my usefulness to you and my fellows.
      \ Grant me strength, as I go out from here, to do your bidding.  Amen.'  We
      have then completed Step Seven.\r\n    Now we need more action, without which
      we find that 'Faith without works is dead.'  Let's look at Steps Eight and Nine.
      \ We have a list of all persons we have harmed and to whom we are willing to
      make amends.  We made it when we took inventory.  We subjected ourselves to
      a drastic self-appraisal.  Now we go out to our fellows and repair the damage
      done in the past.  We attempt to sweep away the debris which has accumulated
      out of our effort to live on self-will and run the show ourselves.  If we haven't
      the will to do this, we ask until it comes.  Remember it was agreed at the beginning
      we would go to any lengths for victory over alcohol.\r\n    Probably there are
      still some misgivings.  As we look over the list of business acquaintances and
      friends we have hurt, we may feel diffident about going to some of them on a
      spiritual basis.  Let us be reassured.  To some people we need not, and probably
      should not emphasize the spiritual feature on our first approach.  We might
      prejudice them.  At the moment we are trying to put our lives in order.  But
      this is not an end in itself.  Our real purpose is to fit ourselves to be of
      maximum service to God and the people about us.  It is seldom wise to approach
      an individual, who still smarts from our injustice to him, and announce that
      we have gone religious.  In the prize ring, this would be called leading with
      the chin.  Why lay ourselves open to being branded fanatics or religious bores?
      \ We may kill a future opportunity to carry a beneficial message.  But our man
      is sure to be impressed with a sincere desire to set right the wrong.  He is
      going to be more interested in a demonstration of good will than in our talk
      of spiritual discoveries.\r\n    We don't use this as an excuse for shying away
      from the subject of God.  When it will serve any good purpose, we are willing
      to announce our convictions with tact and common sense.  The question of how
      to approach the man we hated will arise.  It may be he has done us more harm
      than we have done him and, though we may have acquired a better attitude toward
      him, we are still not too keen about admitting our faults.  Nevertheless, with
      a person we dislike, we take the bit in our teeth.  It is harder to go to an
      enemy than to a friend, but we find it much more beneficial to us.  We go to
      him in a helpful and forgiving spirit, confessing our former ill feeling and
      expressing our regret.\r\n    Under no condition do we criticize such a person
      or argue.  Simply we tell him that we will never get over drinking until we
      have done our utmost to straighten out the past.  We are there to sweep off
      our side of the street, realizing that nothing worth while can be accomplished
      until we do so, never trying to tell him what he should do.  His faults are
      not discussed.  We stick to our own.  If our manner is calm, frank, and open,
      we will be gratified with the result.\r\n    In nine cases out of ten the unexpected
      happens.  Sometimes the man we are calling upon admits his own fault, so feuds
      of years' standing melt away in an hour.  Rarely do we fail to make satisfactory
      progress.  Our former enemies sometimes praise what we are doing and wish us
      well.  Occasionally, they will offer assistance.  It should not matter, however,
      if someone does throw us out of his office.  We have made our demonstration,
      done our part.  It's water over the dam.\r\n    Most alcoholics owe money.  We
      do not dodge our creditors.  Telling them what we are trying to do, we make
      no bones about our drinking; they usually know it anyway, whether we think so
      or not.  Nor are we afraid of disclosing our alcoholism on the theory it may
      cause financial harm.  Approached in this way, the most ruthless creditor will
      sometimes surprise us.  Arranging the best deal we can we let these people know
      we are sorry.  Our drinking has made us slow to pay.  We must lose our fear
      of creditors no matter how far we have to go, for we are liable to drink if
      we are afraid to face them.\r\n    Perhaps we have committed a criminal offense
      which might land us in jail if it were known to the authorities.  We may be
      short in our accounts and unable to make good.  We have already admitted this
      in confidence to another person, but we are sure we would be imprisoned or lose
      our job if it were known.  Maybe it's only a petty offense such as padding the
      expense account.  Most of us have done that sort of thing.  Maybe we are divorced,
      and have remarried but haven't kept up the alimony to number one.  She is indignant
      about it, and has a warrant out for our arrest.  That's a common form of trouble
      too.\r\n    Although these reparations take innumerable forms, there are some
      general principles which we find guiding.  Reminding ourselves that we have
      decided to go to any lengths to find a spiritual experience, we ask that we
      be given strength and direction to do the right thing, no matter what the personal
      consequences may be.  We may lose our position or reputation or face jail, but
      we are willing.  We have to be.  We must not shrink at anything.\r\n    Usually,
      however, other people are involved.  Therefore, we are not to be the hasty and
      foolish martyr who would needlessly sacrifice others to save himself from the
      alcoholic pit.  A man we know had remarried.  Because of resentment and drinking,
      he had not paid alimony to his first wife.  She was furious.  She went to court
      and got an order for his arrest.  He had commenced our way of life, had secured
      a position, and was getting his head above water.  It would have been impressive
      heroics if he had walked up to the Judge and said, 'Here I am.'\r\n    We thought
      he ought to be willing to do that if necessary, but if he were in jail he could
      provide nothing for either family.  We suggested he write his first wife admitting
      his faults and asking forgiveness.  He did, and also sent a small amount of
      money.  He told her what he would try to do in the future.  He said he was perfectly
      willing to go to jail if she insisted.  Of course she did not, and the whole
      situation has long since been adjusted.\r\n    Before taking drastic action
      which might implicate other people we secure their consent.  If we have obtained
      permission, have consulted with others, asked God to help and the drastic step
      is indicated we must not shrink.\r\n    This brings to mind a story about one
      of our friends.  While drinking, he accepted a sum of money from a bitterly-hated
      business rival, giving him no receipt for it.  He subsequently denied having
      received the money and used the incident as a basis for discrediting the man.
      \ He thus used his own wrong-doing as a means of destroying the reputation of
      another.  In fact, his rival was ruined.\r\n    He felt that he had done a wrong
      he could not possibly make right.  If he opened that old affair, he was afraid
      it would destroy the reputation of his partner, disgrace his family and take
      away his means of livelihood.  What right had he to involve those dependent
      upon him?  How could he possibly make a public statement exonerating his rival?\r\n
      \   After consulting with his wife and partner he came to the conclusion that
      is was better to take those risks than to stand before his Creator guilty of
      such ruinous slander.  He saw that he had to place the outcome in God's hands
      or he would soon start drinking again, and all would be lost anyhow.  He attended
      church for the first time in many years.  After the sermon, he quietly got up
      and made an explanation.  His action met wide-spread approval, and today he
      is one of the most trusted citizens of his town.  This all happened years ago.\r\n
      \   The chances are that we have domestic troubles.  Perhaps we are mixed up
      with women in a fashion we wouldn't care to have advertised.  We doubt if, in
      this respect, alcoholics are fundamentally much worse than other people.  But
      drinking does complicate sex relations in the home.  After a few years with
      an alcoholic, a wife gets worn out, resentful and uncommunicative.  How could
      she be anything else?  The husband begins to feel lonely, sorry for himself.
      \ He commences to look around in the night clubs, or their equivalent, for something
      besides liquor.  Perhaps he is having a secret and exciting affair with 'the
      girl who understands.'  In fairness we must say that she may understand, but
      what are we going to do about a thing like that?  A man so involved often feels
      very remorseful at times, especially if he is married to a loyal and courageous
      girl who has literally gone through hell for him.\r\n    Whatever the situation,
      we usually have to do something about it.  If we are sure our wife does not
      know, should we tell her?  Not always, we think.  If she knows in a general
      way that we have been wild, should we tell her in detail?  Undoubtedly we should
      admit our fault.  She may insist on knowing all the particulars.  She will want
      to know who the woman is and where she is.  We feel we ought to say to her that
      we have no right to involve another person.  We are sorry for what we have done
      and, God willing, it shall not be repeated.  More than that we cannot do; we
      have no right to go further.  Though there may be justifiable exceptions, and
      though we wish to lay down no rule of any sort, we have often found this the
      best course to take.\r\n    Our design for living is not a one-way street.  It
      is as good for the wife as for the husband.  If we can forget, so can she.  It
      is better, however, that one does not needlessly name a person upon whom she
      can vent jealousy.\r\n    Perhaps there are some cases where the utmost frankness
      is demanded.  No outsider can appraise such an intimate situation.  It may be
      that both will decide that the way of good sense and loving kindness is to let
      by-gones be by-gones.  Each might pray about it, having the other one's happiness
      uppermost in mind.  Keep it always in sight that we are dealing with that most
      terrible human emotion-jealousy.  Good generalship may decide that the problem
      be attacked on the flank rather than risk a face-to-face combat.\r\n    If we
      have no such complication, there is plenty we should do at home.  Sometimes
      we hear an alcoholic say that the only thing he needs to do is to keep sober.
      \ Certainly he must keep sober, for there will be no home if he doesn't.  But
      he is yet a long way from making good to the wife or parents whom for years
      he has so shockingly treated.  Passing all understanding is the patience mothers
      and wives have had with alcoholics.  Had this not been so, many of us would
      have no homes today, would perhaps be dead.\r\n    The alcoholic is like a tornado
      roaring his way through the lives of others.  Hearts are broken.  Sweet relationships
      are dead.  Affections have been uprooted.  Selfish and inconsiderate habits
      have kept the home in turmoil.  We feel a man is unthinking when he says that
      sobriety is enough.  He is like the farmer who came up out of his cyclone cellar
      to find his home ruined.  To his wife, he remarked, 'Don't see anything the
      matter here, Ma.  Ain't it grand the wind stopped blowin'?'\r\n    Yes, there
      is a long period of reconstruction ahead.  We must take the lead.  A remorseful
      mumbling that we are sorry won't fill the bill at all.  We ought to sit down
      with the family and frankly analyze the past as we now see it, being very careful
      not to criticize them.  Their defects may be glaring, but the chances are that
      our own actions are partly responsible.  So we clean house with the family,
      asking each morning in meditation that our Creator show us the way of patience,
      tolerance, kindliness and love.\r\n    The spiritual life is not a theory.  We
      have to live it.  Unless one's family expresses a desire to live upon spiritual
      principles we think we ought not to urge them.  We should not talk incessantly
      to them about spiritual matters.  They will change in time.  Our behavior will
      convince them more than our words.  We must remember that ten or twenty years
      of drunkenness would make a skeptic out of anyone.\r\n    There may be some
      wrongs we can never fully right.  We don't worry about them if we can honestly
      say to ourselves that we would right them if we could.  Some people cannot be
      seen-we send them an honest letter.  And there may be a valid reason for postponement
      in some cases.  But we don't delay if it can be avoided.  We should be sensible,
      tactful, considerate and humble without being servile or scraping.  As God's
      people we stand on our feet; we don't crawl before anyone.\r\n    If we are
      painstaking about this phase of our development, we will be amazed before we
      are half way through.  We are going to know a new freedom and a new happiness.
      \ We will not regret the past nor wish to shut the door on it.  We will comprehend
      the word serenity and we will know peace.  No matter how far down the scale
      we have gone, we will see how our experience can benefit others.  That feeling
      of uselessness and self-pity will disappear.  We will lose interest in selfish
      things and gain interest in our fellows.  Self-seeking will slip away.  Our
      whole attitude and outlook upon life will change.  Fear of people and of economic
      insecurity will leave us.  We will intuitively know how to handle situations
      which used to baffle us.  We will suddenly realize that God is doing for us
      what we could not do for ourselves.\r\n    Are these extravagant promises?  We
      think not.  They are being fulfilled among us-sometimes quickly, sometimes slowly.
      \ They will always materialize if we work for them.\r\n    This thought brings
      us to Step Ten, which suggests we continue to take personal inventory and continue
      to set right any new mistakes as we go along.  We vigorously commenced this
      way of living as we cleaned up the past.  We have entered the world of the Spirit.
      \ Our next function is to grow in understanding and effectiveness.  This is
      not an overnight matter.  It should continue for our lifetime.  Continue to
      watch for selfishness, dishonesty, resentment, and fear.  When these crop up,
      we ask God at once to remove them.  We discuss them with someone immediately
      and make amends quickly if we have harmed anyone.  Then we resolutely turn our
      thoughts to someone we can help.  Love and tolerance of others is our code.\r\n
      \   And we have ceased fighting anything or anyone-even alcohol.  For by this
      time sanity will have returned.  We will seldom be interested in liquor.  If
      tempted, we recoil from it as from a hot flame.  We react sanely and normally,
      and we will find that this has happened automatically.  We will see that our
      new attitude toward liquor has been given us without any thought or effort on
      our part.  It just comes!  That is the miracle of it.  We are not fighting it,
      neither are we avoiding temptation.  We feel as though we had been placed in
      a position of neutrality-safe and protected.  We have not even sworn off.  Instead,
      the problem has been removed.  It does not exist for us.  We are neither cocky
      nor are we afraid.  That is our experience.  That is how we react so long as
      we keep in fit spiritual condition.\r\n    It is easy to let up on the spiritual
      program of action and rest on our laurels.  We are headed for trouble if we
      do, for alcohol is a subtle foe.  We are not cured of alcoholism.  What we really
      have is a daily reprieve contingent on the maintenance of our spiritual condition.
      \ Every day is a day when we must carry the vision of God's will into all of
      our activities.  'How can I best serve Thee-Thy will (not mine) be done.'  These
      are thoughts which must go with us constantly.  We can exercise our will power
      along this line all we wish.  It is the proper use of the will.\r\n    Much
      has already been said about receiving strength, inspiration, and direction from
      Him who has all knowledge and power.  If we have carefully followed directions,
      we have begun to sense the flow of His Spirit into us.  To some extent we have
      become God-conscious.  We have begun to develop this vital sixth sense.  But
      we must go further and that means more action.\r\n    Step Eleven suggests prayer
      and meditation.  We shouldn't be shy on this matter of prayer.  Better men than
      we are using it constantly.  It works, if we have the proper attitude and work
      at it.  It would be easy to be vague about this matter.  Yet, we believe we
      can make some definite and valuable suggestions.\r\n    When we retire at night,
      we constructively review our day.  Were we resentful, selfish, dishonest or
      afraid?  Do we owe an apology?  Have we kept something to ourselves which should
      be discussed with another person at once?  Were we kind and loving toward all?
      \ What could we have done better?  Were we thinking of ourselves most of the
      time?  Or were we thinking of what we could do for others, of what we could
      pack into the stream of life?  But we must be careful not to drift into worry,
      remorse or morbid reflection, for that would diminish our usefulness to others.
      \ After making our review we ask God's forgiveness and inquire what corrective
      measures should be taken.\r\n    On awakening let us think about the twenty-four
      hours ahead.  We consider our plans for the day.  Before we begin, we ask God
      to direct our thinking, especially asking that it be divorced from self-pity,
      dishonest or self-seeking motives.  Under these conditions we can employ our
      mental faculties with assurance, for after all God gave us brains to use.  Our
      thought-life will be placed on a much higher plane when our thinking is cleared
      of wrong motives. \r\n    In thinking about our day we may face indecision.
      \ We may not be able to determine which course to take.  Here we ask God for
      inspiration, an intuitive thought or a decision.  We relax and take it easy.
      \ We don't struggle.  We are often surprised how the right answers come after
      we have tried this for a while.  What used to be the hunch or the occasional
      inspiration gradually becomes a working part of the mind.  Being still inexperienced
      and having just made conscious contact with God, it is not probable that we
      are going to be inspired at all times.  We might pay for this presumption in
      all sorts of absurd actions and ideas.  Nevertheless, we find that our thinking
      will, as time passes, be more and more on the plane of inspiration.  We come
      to rely upon it.\r\n    We usually conclude the period of meditation with a
      prayer that we be shown all through the day what our next step is to be, that
      we be given whatever we need to take care of such problems.  We ask especially
      for freedom from self-will, and are careful to make no request for ourselves
      only.  We may ask for ourselves, however, if others will be helped.  We are
      careful never to pray for our own selfish ends.  Many of us have wasted a lot
      of time doing that and it doesn't work.  You can easily see why.\r\n    If circumstances
      warrant, we ask our wives or friends to join us in morning meditation.  If we
      belong to a religious denomination which requires a definite morning devotion,
      we attend to that also.  If not members of religious bodies, we sometimes select
      and memorize a few set prayers which emphasize the principles we have been discussing.
      \ There are many helpful books also.  Suggestions about these may be obtained
      from one's priest, minister, or rabbi.  Be quick to see where religious people
      are right.  Make use of what they offer.\r\n    As we go through the day we
      pause, when agitated or doubtful, and ask for the right thought or action.  We
      constantly remind ourselves we are no longer running the show, humbly saying
      to ourselves many times each day 'Thy will be done.'  We are then in much less
      danger of excitement, fear, anger, worry, self-pity, or foolish decisions.  We
      become much more efficient.  We do not tire so easily, for we are not burning
      up energy foolishly as we did when we were trying to arrange life to suit ourselves.\r\n
      \   It works-it really does.\r\n    We alcoholics are undisciplined.  So we
      let God discipline us in the simple way we have just outlined.\r\n    But this
      is not all.  There is action and more action.  'Faith without works is dead.'
      \ The next chapter is entirely devoted to Step Twelve."
    - '6'
  - - '7'
    - WORKING WITH OTHERS
    - "PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE shows that nothing will so much insure immunity from drinking
      as intensive work with other alcoholics.  It works when other activities fail.
      \ This is our twelfth suggestion: Carry this message to other alcoholics!  You
      can help when no one else can.  You can secure their confidence when others
      fail.  Remember they are very ill.\r\n    Life will take on new meaning.  To
      watch people recover, to see them help others, to watch loneliness vanish, to
      see a fellowship grow up about you, to have a host of friends-this is an experience
      you must not miss.  We know you will not want to miss it.  Frequent contact
      with newcomers and with each other is the bright spot of our lives.\r\n    Perhaps
      you are not acquainted with any drinkers who want to recover.  You can easily
      find some by asking a few doctors, ministers, priests or hospitals.  They will
      be only too glad to assist you.  Don't start out as an evangelist or reformer.
      \ Unfortunately a lot of prejudice exists.  You will be handicapped if you arouse
      it.  Ministers and doctors are competent and you can learn much from them if
      you wish, but it happens that because of your own drinking experience you can
      be uniquely useful to other alcoholics.  So cooperate; never criticize.  To
      be helpful is our only aim.\r\n    When you discover a prospect for Alcoholics
      Anonymous, find out all you can about him.  If he does not want to stop drinking,
      don't waste time trying to persuade him.  You may spoil a later opportunity.
      \ This advice is given for his family also.  They should be patient, realizing
      they are dealing with a sick person.\r\n    If there is any indication that
      he wants to stop,  have a good talk with the person most interested in him-usually
      his wife.  Get an idea of his behavior, his problems, his background, the seriousness
      of his condition, and his religious leanings.  You need this information to
      put yourself in his place, to see how you would like him to approach you if
      the tables were turned.\r\n    Sometimes it is wise to wait till he goes on
      a binge.  The family may object to this, but unless he is in a dangerous physical
      condition, it is better to risk it.  Don't deal with him when he is very drunk,
      unless he is ugly and the family needs your help.  Wait for the end of the spree,
      or at least for a lucid interval.  Then let his family or a friend ask him if
      he wants to quit for good and if he would go to any extreme to do so.  If he
      says yes, then his attention should be drawn to you as a person who has recovered.
      \ You should be described to him as one of a fellowship who, as part of their
      own recovery, try to help others and who will be glad to talk to him if he cares
      to see you.\r\n    If he does not want to see you, never force yourself upon
      him.  Neither should the family hysterically plead with him to do anything,
      nor should they tell him much about you.  They should wait for the end of his
      next drinking bout.  You might place this book where he can see it in the interval.
      \ Here no specific rule can be given.  The family must decide these things.
      \ But urge them not to be over-anxious, for that might spoil matters.\r\n    Usually
      the family should not try to tell your story.  When possible, avoid meeting
      a man through his family.  Approach through a doctor or an institution is a
      better bet.  If your man needs hospitalization, he should have it, but not forcibly
      unless he is violent.  Let the doctor, if he will, tell him he has something
      in the way of a solution.\r\n    When your man is better, the doctor might suggest
      a visit from you.  Though you have talked with the family, leave them out of
      the first discussion.  Under these conditions your prospect will see he is under
      no pressure.  He will feel he can deal with you without being nagged by his
      family.  Call on him while he is still jittery.  He may be more receptive when
      depressed.\r\n    See your man alone, if possible.  At first engage in general
      conversation.  After a while, turn the talk to some phase of drinking.  Tell
      him enough about your drinking habits, symptoms, and experiences to encourage
      him to speak of himself.  If he wishes to talk, let him do so.  You will thus
      get a better idea of how you ought to proceed.  If he is not communicative,
      give him a sketch of your drinking career up to the time you quit.  But say
      nothing, for the moment, of how that was accomplished.  If he is in a serious
      mood dwell on the troubles liquor has caused you, being careful not to moralize
      or lecture.  If his mood is light, tell him humorous stories of your escapades.
      \ Get him to tell some of his.\r\n    When he sees you know all about the drinking
      game, commence to describe yourself as an alcoholic.  Tell him how baffled you
      were, how you finally learned that you were sick.  Give him an account of the
      struggles you made to stop.  Show him the mental twist which leads to the first
      drink of a spree.  We suggest you do this as we have done it in the chapter
      on alcoholism.  If he is alcoholic, he will understand you at once.  He will
      match your mental inconsistencies with some of his own.\r\n    If you are satisfied
      that he is a real alcoholic, begin to dwell on the hopeless feature of the malady.
      \ Show him, from your own experience, how the queer mental condition surrounding
      that first drink prevents normal functioning of the will power.  Don't, at this
      stage, refer to this book, unless he has seen it and wishes to discuss it.  And
      be careful not to brand him as an alcoholic.  Let him draw his own conclusion.
      \ If he sticks to the idea that he can still control his drinking, tell him
      that possibly he can-if he is not too alcoholic.  But insist that if he is severely
      afflicted, there may be little chance he can recover by himself.\r\n    Continue
      to speak of alcoholism as an illness, a fatal malady.  Talk about the conditions
      of body and mind which accompany it.  Keep his attention focused mainly on your
      personal experience.  Explain that many are doomed who never realize their predicament.
      \ Doctors are rightly loath to tell alcoholic patients the whole story unless
      it will serve some good purpose.  But you may talk to him about the hopelessness
      of alcoholism because you offer a solution.  You will soon have your friend
      admitting he has many, if not all, of the traits of the alcoholic.  If his own
      doctor is willing to tell him that he is alcoholic, so much the better.  Even
      though your protégé may not have entirely admitted his condition, he has become
      very curious to know how you got well.  Let him ask you that question, if he
      will.  Tell him exactly what happened to you.  Stress the spiritual feature
      freely.  If the man be agnostic or atheist, make it emphatic that he does not
      have to agree with your conception of God.  He can choose any conception he
      likes, provided it makes sense to him.  The main thing is that he be willing
      to believe in a Power greater than himself and that he live by spiritual principles.\r\n
      \   When dealing with such a person, you had better use everyday language to
      describe spiritual principles.  There is no use arousing any prejudice he may
      have against certain theological terms and conceptions about which he may already
      be confused.  Don't raise such issues, no matter what your own convictions are.\r\n
      \   Your prospect may belong to a religious denomination.  His religious education
      and training may be far superior to yours.  In that case he is going to wonder
      how you can add anything to what he already knows.  But he will be curious to
      learn why his own convictions have not worked and why yours seem to work so
      well.  He may be an example of the truth that faith alone is insufficient.  To
      be vital, faith must be accompanied by self sacrifice and unselfish, constructive
      action.  Let him see that you are not there to instruct him in religion.  Admit
      that he probably knows more about it than you do, but call to his attention
      the fact that however deep his faith and knowledge, he could not have applied
      it or he would not drink.  Perhaps your story will help him see where he has
      failed to practice the very precepts he knows so well.  We represent no particular
      faith or denomination.  We are dealing only with general principles common to
      most denominations.\r\n    Outline the program of action, explaining how you
      made a self-appraisal, how you straightened out your past and why you are now
      endeavoring to be helpful to him.  It is important for him to realize that your
      attempt to pass this on to him plays a vital part in your own recovery.  Actually,
      he may be helping you more than you are helping him.  Make it plain he is under
      no obligation to you, that you hope only that he will try to help other alcoholics
      when he escapes his own difficulties.  Suggest how important it is that he place
      the welfare of other people ahead of his own.  Make it clear that he is not
      under pressure, that he needn't see you again if he doesn't want to.  You should
      not be offended if he wants to call it off, for he has helped you more than
      you have helped him.  If your talk has been sane, quiet and full of human understanding,
      you have perhaps made a friend.  Maybe you have disturbed him about the question
      of alcoholism.  This is all to the good.  The more hopeless he feels, the better.
      \ He will be more likely to follow your suggestions.\r\n    Your candidate may
      give reasons why he need not follow all of the program.  He may rebel at the
      thought of a drastic housecleaning which requires discussion with other people.
      \ Do not contradict such views.  Tell him you once felt as he does, but you
      doubt whether you would have made much progress had you not taken action.  On
      your first visit tell him about the Fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous.  If
      he shows interest, lend him your copy of this book.\r\n    Unless your friend
      wants to talk further about himself, do not wear out your welcome.  Give him
      a chance to think it over.  If you do stay, let him steer the conversation in
      any direction he likes.  Sometimes a new man is anxious to proceed at once.
      And you may be tempted to let him do so.  This is sometimes a mistake.  If he
      has trouble later, he is likely to say you rushed him.  You will be most successful
      with alcoholics if you do not exhibit any passion for crusade or reform.  Never
      talk down to an alcoholic from any moral or spiritual hilltop; simply lay out
      the kit of spiritual tools for his inspection.  Show him how they worked with
      you.  Offer him friendship and fellowship.  Tell him that if he wants to get
      well you will do anything to help.\r\n    If he is not interested in your solution,
      if he expects you to act only as a banker for his financial difficulties or
      a nurse for his sprees, you may have to drop him until he changes his mind.
      \ This he may do after he gets hurt some more.\r\n    If he is sincerely interested
      and wants to see you again, ask him to read this book in the interval.  After
      doing that, he must decide for himself whether he wants to go on.  He should
      not be pushed or prodded by you, his wife, or his friends.  If he is to find
      God, the desire must come from within.\r\n    If he thinks he can do the job
      in some other way, or prefers some other spiritual approach, encourage him to
      follow his own conscience.  We have no monopoly on God; we merely have an approach
      that worked with us.  But point out that we alcoholics have much in common and
      that you would like, in any case, to be friendly.  Let it go at that.\r\n    Do
      not be discouraged if your prospect does not respond at once.  Search out another
      alcoholic and try again.  You are sure to find someone desperate enough to accept
      with eagerness what you offer.  We find it a waste of time to keep chasing a
      man who cannot or will not work with you.  If you leave such a person alone,
      he may soon become convinced that he cannot recover by himself.  To spend too
      much time on any one situation is to deny some other alcoholic an opportunity
      to live and be happy.  One of our Fellowship failed entirely with his first
      half dozen prospects.  He often says that if he had continued to work on them,
      he might have deprived many others, who have since recovered, of their chance.\r\n
      \   Suppose now you are making your second visit to a man.  He has read this
      volume and says he is prepared to go through with the Twelve Steps of the program
      of recovery.  Having had the experience yourself, you can give him much practical
      advice.  Let him know you are available if he wishes to make a decision and
      tell his story, but do not insist upon it if he prefers to consult someone else.\r\n
      \   He may be broke and homeless.  If he is, you might try to help him about
      getting a job, or give him a little financial assistance.  But you should not
      deprive your family or creditors of money they should have.  Perhaps you will
      want to take the man into your home for a few days.  But be sure you use discretion.
      \ Be certain he will be welcomed by your family, and that he is not trying to
      impose upon you for money, connections, or shelter.  Permit that and you only
      harm him.  You will be making it possible for him to be insincere.  You may
      be aiding in his destruction rather than his recovery.\r\n    Never avoid these
      responsibilities, but be sure you are doing the right thing if you assume them.
      \ Helping others is the foundation stone of your recovery.  A kindly act once
      in a while isn't enough.  You have to act the Good Samaritan every day, if need
      be.  It may mean the loss of many nights' sleep, great interference with your
      pleasures, interruptions to your business.  It may mean sharing your money and
      your home, counseling frantic wives and relatives, innumerable trips to police
      courts, sanitariums, hospitals, jails and asylums.  Your telephone may jangle
      at any time of the day or night.  Your wife may sometimes say she is neglected.
      \ A drunk may smash the furniture in your home, or burn a mattress.  You may
      have to fight with him if he is violent.  Sometimes you will have to call a
      doctor and administer sedatives under his direction.  Another time you may have
      to send for the police or an ambulance.  Occasionally you will have to meet
      such conditions.\r\n    We seldom allow an alcoholic to live in our homes for
      long at a time.  It is not good for him, and it sometimes creates serious complications
      in a family.\r\n    Though an alcoholic does not respond, there is no reason
      why you should neglect his family.  You should continue to be friendly to them.
      \ The family should be offered your way of life.  Should they accept and practice
      spiritual principles, there is a much better chance that the head of the family
      will recover.  And even though he continues to drink, the family will find life
      more bearable.\r\n    For the type of alcoholic who is able and willing to get
      well, little charity, in the ordinary sense of the word, is needed or wanted.
      \ The men who cry for money and shelter before conquering alcohol, are on the
      wrong track.  Yet we do go to great extremes to provide each other with these
      very things, when such action is warranted.  This may seem inconsistent, but
      we think it is not.\r\n    It is not the matter of giving that is in question,
      but when and how to give.  That often makes the difference between failure and
      success.  The minute we put our work on a service plane, the alcoholic commences
      to rely upon our assistance rather than upon God.  He clamors for this or that,
      claiming he cannot master alcohol until his material needs are cared for.  Nonsense.
      \ Some of us have taken very hard knocks to learn this truth: Job or no job-wife
      or no wife-we simply do not stop drinking so long as we place dependence upon
      other people ahead of dependence on God.\r\n    Burn the idea into the consciousness
      of every man that he can get well regardless of anyone.  The only condition
      is that he trust in God and clean house.\r\n    Now, the domestic problem: There
      may be divorce, separation, or just strained relations.  When your prospect
      has made such reparation as he can to his family, and has thoroughly explained
      to them the new principles by which he is living, he should proceed to put those
      principles into action at home.  That is, if he is lucky enough to have a home.
      \ Though his family be at fault in many respects, he should not be concerned
      about that.  He should concentrate on his own spiritual demonstration.  Argument
      and fault-finding are to be avoided like the plague.  In many homes this is
      a difficult thing to do, but it must be done if any results are to be expected.
      \ If persisted in for a few months, the effect on a man's family is sure to
      be great.  The most incompatible people discover they have a basis upon which
      they can meet.  Little by little the family may see their own defects and admit
      them.  These can then be discussed in an atmosphere of helpfulness and friendliness.\r\n
      \   After they have seen tangible results, the family will perhaps want to go
      along.  These things will come to pass naturally and in good time provided,
      however, the alcoholic continues to demonstrate that he can be sober, considerate,
      and helpful, regardless of what anyone says or does.  Of course, we all fall
      much below this standard many times.  But we must try to repair the damage immediately
      lest we pay the penalty by a spree.\r\n    If there be divorce or separation,
      there should be no undue haste for the couple to get together.  The man should
      be sure of his recovery.  The wife should fully understand his new way of life.
      \ If their old relationship is to be resumed it must be on a better basis, since
      the former did not work.  This means a new attitude and spirit all around.  Sometimes
      it is to the best interest of all concerned that a couple remain apart.  Obviously,
      no rule can be laid down.  Let the alcoholic continue his program day by day.
      \ When the time for living together has come, it will be apparent to both parties.\r\n
      \   Let no alcoholic say he cannot recover unless he has his family back.  This
      just isn't so.  In some cases the wife will never come back for one reason or
      another.  Remind the prospect that his recovery is not dependent upon people.
      \ It is dependent upon his relationship with God.  We have seen men get well
      whose families have not returned at all.  We have seen others slip when the
      family came back too soon.\r\n    Both you and the new man must walk day by
      day in the path of spiritual progress.  If you persist, remarkable things will
      happen.  When we look back, we realize that the things which came to us when
      we put ourselves in God's hands were better than anything we could have planned.
      \ Follow the dictates of a Higher Power and you will presently live in a new
      and wonderful world, no matter what your present  circumstances!\r\n    When
      working with a man and his family, you should take care not to participate in
      their quarrels.  You may spoil your chance of being helpful if you do.  But
      urge upon a man's family that he has been a very sick person and should be treated
      accordingly.  You should warn against arousing resentment or jealousy.  You
      should point out that his defects of character are not going to disappear over
      night.  Show them that he has entered upon a period of growth.  Ask them to
      remember, when they are impatient, the blessed fact of his sobriety.\r\n    If
      you have been successful in solving your own domestic problems, tell the newcomer's
      family how that was accomplished.  In this way you can set them on the right
      track without becoming critical of them.  The story of how you and your wife
      settled your difficulties is worth any amount of criticism.\r\n    Assuming
      we are spiritually fit, we can do all sorts of things alcoholics are not supposed
      to do.  People have said we must not go where liquor is served; we must not
      have it in our homes; we must shun friends who drink; we must avoid moving pictures
      which show drinking scenes; we must not go into bars; our friends must hide
      their bottles if we go to their houses; we mustn't think or be reminded about
      alcohol at all.  Our experience shows that this is not necessarily so.\r\n    We
      meet these conditions every day.  An alcoholic who cannot meet them, still has
      an alcoholic mind; there is something the matter with his spiritual status.
      \ His only chance for sobriety would be some place like the Greenland Ice Cap,
      and even there an Eskimo might turn up with a bottle of scotch and ruin everything!
      \ Ask any woman who has sent her husband to distant places on the theory he
      would escape the alcohol problem.\r\n    In our belief any scheme of combating
      alcoholism which proposes to shield the sick man from temptation is doomed to
      failure.  If the alcoholic tries to shield himself he may succeed for a time,
      but he usually winds up with a bigger explosion than ever.  We have tried these
      methods.  These attempts to do the impossible have always failed.\r\n    So
      our rule is not to avoid a place where there is drinking, if we have a legitimate
      reason for being there.  That includes bars, nightclubs, dances, receptions,
      weddings, even plain ordinary whoopee parties.  To a person who has had experience
      with an alcoholic, this may seem like tempting Providence, but it isn't.\r\n
      \   You will note that we made an important qualification.  Therefore, ask yourself
      on each occasion, 'Have I any good social, business, or personal reason for
      going to this place?  Or am I expecting to steal a little vicarious pleasure
      from the atmosphere of such places?'  If you answer these questions satisfactorily,
      you need have no apprehension.  Go or stay away, whichever seems best.  But
      be sure you are on solid spiritual ground before you start and that your motive
      in going is thoroughly good.  Do not think of what you will get out of the occasion.
      \ Think of what you can bring to it.  But if you are shaky, you had better work
      with another alcoholic instead!\r\n    Why sit with a long face in places where
      there is drinking, sighing about the good old days.  If it is a happy occasion,
      try to increase the pleasure of those there; if a business occasion, go and
      attend to your business enthusiastically.  If you are with a person who wants
      to eat in a bar, by all means go along.  Let your friends know they are not
      to change their habits on your account.  At a proper time and place explain
      to all your friends why alcohol disagrees with you.  If you do this thoroughly,
      few people will ask you to drink.  While you were drinking, you were withdrawing
      from life little by little.  Now you are getting back into the social life of
      this world.  Don't start to withdraw again just because your friends drink liquor.\r\n
      \   Your job now is to be at the place where you may be of maximum helpfulness
      to others, so never hesitate to go anywhere if you can be helpful.  You should
      not hesitate to visit the most sordid spot on earth on such an errand.  Keep
      on the firing line of life with these motives and God will keep you unharmed.\r\n
      \   Many of us keep liquor in our homes.  We often need it to carry green recruits
      through a severe hangover  Some of us still serve it to our friends provided
      they are not alcoholic.  But some of us think we should not serve liquor to
      anyone.  We never argue this question.  We feel that each family, in the light
      of their own circumstances, ought to decide for themselves.\r\n    We are careful
      never to show intolerance or hatred of drinking as an institution.  Experience
      shows that such an attitude is not helpful to anyone.  Every new alcoholic looks
      for this spirit among us and is immensely relieved when he finds we are not
      witch burners.  A spirit of intolerance might repel alcoholics whose lives could
      have been saved, had it not been for such stupidity.  We would not even do the
      cause of temperate drinking any good, for not one drinker in a thousand likes
      to be told anything about alcohol by one who hates it.\r\n    Some day we hope
      that Alcoholics Anonymous will help the public to a better realization of the
      gravity of the alcoholic problem, but we shall be of little use if our attitude
      is one of bitterness or hostility.  Drinkers will not stand for it.\r\n    After
      all, our problems were of our own making.  Bottles were only a symbol.  Besides,
      we have stopped fighting anybody or anything.  We have to!"

    - TO WIVES
    - "WITH FEW EXCEPTIONS, our book thus far has spoken of men.  But what we have
      said applies quite as much to women.  Our activities in behalf of women who
      drink are on the increase.  There is every evidence that women regain their
      health as readily as men if they try our suggestions.\r\n    But for every man
      who drinks others are involved-the wife who trembles in fear of the next debauch;
      the mother and father who see their son wasting away.\r\n    Among us are wives,
      relatives and friends whose problem has been solved, as well as some who have
      not yet found a happy solution.  We want the wives of Alcoholics Anonymous to
      address the wives of men who drink too much.  What they say will apply to nearly
      everyone bound by ties of blood or affection to an alcoholic.\r\n    As wives
      of Alcoholics Anonymous, we would like you to feel that we understand as perhaps
      few can.  We want to analyze mistakes we have made.  We want to leave you with
      the feeling that no situation is too difficult and no unhappiness too great
      to be overcome.\r\n    We have traveled a rocky road, there is no mistake about
      that.  We have had long rendezvous with hurt pride, frustration, self-pity,
      misunderstanding and fear.  These are not pleasant companions.  We have been
      driven to maudlin sympathy, to bitter resentment.  Some of us veered from extreme
      to extreme, ever hoping that one day our loved ones would be themselves once
      more.\r\n    Our loyalty and the desire that our husbands hold up their heads
      and be like other men have begotten all sorts of predicaments.  We have been
      unselfish and self-sacrificing.  We have told innumerable lies to protect our
      pride and our husbands' reputations.  We have prayed, we have begged, we have
      been patient.  We have struck out viciously.  We have run away.  We have been
      hysterical.  We have been terror stricken.  We have sought sympathy.  We have
      had retaliatory love affairs with other men.\r\n    Our homes have been battle-grounds
      many an evening.  In the morning we have kissed and made up.  Our friends have
      counseled chucking the men and we have done so with finality, only to be back
      in a little while hoping, always hoping.  Our men have sworn great solemn oaths
      that they were through drinking forever.  We have believed them when no one
      else could or would.  Then, in days, weeks, or months, a fresh outburst.\r\n
      \   We seldom had friends at our homes, never knowing how or when the men of
      the house would appear.  We could make few social engagements.  We came to live
      almost alone.  When we were invited out, our husbands sneaked so many drinks
      that they spoiled the occasion.  If, on the other hand, they took nothing, their
      self-pity made them killjoys.\r\n    There was never financial security.  Positions
      were always in jeopardy or gone.  An armored car could  not have brought the
      pay envelopes home.  The checking account melted like snow in June.\r\n    Sometimes
      there were other women.  How heartbreaking was this discovery; how cruel to
      be told they understood our men as we did not!\r\n    The bill collectors, the
      sheriffs, the angry taxi drivers, the policemen, the bums, the pals, and even
      the ladies they sometimes brought home-our husbands thought we were so inhospitable.
      \ 'Joykiller, nag, wet blanket'-that's what they said.  Next day they would
      be themselves again and we would forgive and try to forget.\r\n    We have tried
      to hold the love of our children for their father.  We have told small tots
      that father was sick, which was much nearer the truth than we realized.  They
      struck the children, kicked out door panels, smashed treasured crockery, and
      ripped the keys out of pianos.  In the midst of such pandemonium they may have
      rushed out threatening to live with the other woman forever.  In desperation,
      we have even got tight ourselves-the drunk to end all drunks.  The unexpected
      result was that our husbands seemed to like it.\r\n    Perhaps at this point
      we got a divorce and took the children home to father and mother.  Then we were
      severely criticized by our husband's parents for desertion.  Usually we did
      not leave.  We stayed on and on.  We finally sought employment ourselves as
      destitution faced us and our families.\r\n    We began to ask medical advice
      as the sprees got closer together.  The alarming physical and mental symptoms,
      the deepening pall of remorse, depression and inferiority that settled down
      on our loved ones-these things terrified and distracted us.  As animals on a
      treadmill, we have patiently and wearily climbed, falling back in exhaustion
      after each futile effort to reach solid ground.  Most of us have entered the
      final stage with its commitment to health resorts, sanitariums, hospitals, and
      jails.  Sometimes there were screaming delirium and insanity.  Death was often
      near.\r\n    Under these conditions we naturally made mistakes.  Some of them
      rose out of ignorance of alcoholism.  Sometimes we sensed dimly that we were
      dealing with sick men.  Had we fully understood the nature of the alcoholic
      illness, we might have behaved differently.\r\n    How could men who loved their
      wives and children be so unthinking, so callous, so cruel?  There could be no
      love in such persons, we thought.  And just as we were being convinced of their
      heartlessness, they would surprise us with fresh resolves and new attentions.
      \ For a while they would be their old sweet selves, only to dash the new structure
      of affection to pieces once more.  Asked why they commenced to drink again,
      they would reply with some silly excuse, or none.  It was so baffling, so heartbreaking.
      \ Could we have been so mistaken in the men we married?  When drinking, they
      were strangers.  Sometimes they were so inaccessible that it seemed as though
      a great wall had been built around them.\r\n    And even if they did not love
      their families, how could they be so blind about themselves?  What had become
      of their judgment, their common sense, their will power?  Why could they not
      see that drink meant ruin to them?  Why was it, when these dangers were pointed
      out that they agreed, and then got drunk again immediately?\r\n    These are
      some of the questions which race through the mind of every woman who has an
      alcoholic husband.  We hope this book has answered some of them.  Perhaps your
      husband has been living in that strange world of alcoholism where everything
      is distorted and exaggerated.  You can see that he really does love you with
      his better self.  Of course, there is such a thing as incompatibility, but in
      nearly every instance the alcoholic only seems to be unloving and inconsiderate;
      it is usually because he is warped and sickened that he says and does these
      appalling things.  Today most of our men are better husbands and fathers than
      ever before.\r\n    Try not to condemn your alcoholic husband no matter what
      he says or does.  He is just another very sick, unreasonable person.  Treat
      him, when you can, as though he had pneumonia.  When he angers you, remember
      that he is very ill.\r\n    There is an important exception to the foregoing.
      \ We realize some men are thoroughly bad-intentioned, that no amount of patience
      will make any difference.  An alcoholic of this temperament may be quick to
      use this chapter as a club over your head.  Don't let him get away with it.
      \ If you are positive he is one of this type you may feel you had better leave.
      \ Is it right to let him ruin your life and the lives of your children?  Especially
      when he has before him a way to stop his drinking and abuse if he really wants
      to pay the price.\r\n    The problem with which you struggle usually falls within
      one of four categories:\r\n    One:  Your husband may be only a heavy drinker.
      \ His drinking may be constant or it may be heavy only on certain occasions.
      \ Perhaps he spends too much money for liquor.  It may be slowing him up mentally
      and physically, but he does not see it.  Sometimes he is a source of embarrassment
      to you and his friends.  He is positive he can handle his liquor, that it does
      him no harm, that drinking is necessary in his business.  He would probably
      be insulted if he were called an alcoholic.  This world is full of people like
      him.  Some will moderate or stop altogether, and some will not.  Of those who
      keep on, a good number will become true alcoholics after a while.\r\n    Two:
      \ Your husband is showing lack of control, for he is unable to stay on the water
      wagon even when he wants to.  He often gets entirely out of hand when drinking.
      \ He admits this is true, but is positive that he will do better.  He has begun
      to try, with or without your cooperation, various means of moderating or staying
      dry.  Maybe he is beginning to lose his friends.  His business may suffer somewhat.
      \ He is worried at times, and is becoming aware that he cannot drink like other
      people.  He sometimes drinks in the morning and through the day also, to hold
      his nervousness in check.  He is remorseful after serious drinking bouts and
      tells you he wants to stop.  But when he gets over the spree, he begins to think
      once more how he can drink moderately next time.  We think this person is in
      danger.  These are the earmarks of a real alcoholic.  Perhaps he can still tend
      to business fairly well.  He has by no means ruined everything.  As we say among
      ourselves, 'He wants to want to stop.'\r\n    Three:  This husband has gone
      much further than husband number two.  Though once like number two he became
      worse.  His friends have slipped away, his home is a near-wreck and he cannot
      hold a position.  Maybe the doctor has been called in, and the weary round of
      sanitariums and hospitals has begun.  He admits he cannot drink like other people,
      but does not see why.  He clings to the notion that he will yet find a way to
      do so.  He may have come to the point where he desperately wants to stop but
      cannot.  His case presents additional questions which we shall try to answer
      for you.  You can be quite hopeful of a situation like this.\r\n    Four:  You
      may have a husband of whom you completely despair.  He has been placed in one
      institution after another.  He is violent, or appears definitely insane when
      drunk.  Sometimes he drinks on the way home from the hospital.  Perhaps he has
      had delirium tremens.  Doctors may shake their heads and advise you to have
      him committed.  Maybe you have already been obliged to put him away.  This picture
      may not be as dark as it looks.  Many of our husbands were just as far gone.
      \ Yet they got well.\r\n    Let's now go back to husband number one.  Oddly
      enough, he is often difficult to deal with.  He enjoys drinking.  It stirs his
      imagination.  His friends feel closer over a highball.  Perhaps you enjoy drinking
      with him yourself when he doesn't go too far.  You have passed happy evenings
      together chatting and drinking before your fire.  Perhaps you both like parties
      which would be dull without liquor.  We have enjoyed such evenings ourselves;
      we had a good time.  We know all about liquor as a social lubricant.  Some,
      but not all of us, think it has its advantages when reasonably used.\r\n    The
      first principle of success is that you should never be angry.  Even though your
      husband becomes unbearable and you have to leave him temporarily, you should,
      if you can, go without rancor.  Patience and good temper are most necessary.\r\n
      \   Our next thought is that you should never tell him what he must do about
      his drinking.  If he gets the idea that you are a nag or killjoy, your chance
      of accomplishing anything useful may be zero.  He will use that as an excuse
      to drink more.  He will tell you he is misunderstood.  This may lead to lonely
      evenings for you.  He may seek someone else to console him-not always another
      man.\r\n    Be determined that your husband's drinking is not going to spoil
      your relations with your children or your friends.  They need your companionship
      and your help.  It is possible to have a full and useful life, though your husband
      continues to drink.  We know women who are unafraid, even happy under these
      conditions.  Do not set your heart on reforming your husband.  You may be unable
      to do so, no matter how hard you try.\r\n    We know these suggestions are sometimes
      difficult to follow, but you will save many a heartbreak if you can succeed
      in observing them.  Your husband may come to appreciate your reasonableness
      and patience.  This may lay the groundwork for a friendly talk about his alcoholic
      problem.  Try to have him bring up the subject himself.  Be sure you are not
      critical during such a discussion.  Attempt instead, to put yourself in his
      place.  Let him see that you want to be helpful rather than critical.\r\n    When
      a discussion does arise, you might suggest he read this book or at least the
      chapter on alcoholism.  Tell him you have been worried, though perhaps needlessly.
      \ You think he ought to know the subject better, as everyone should have a clear
      understanding of the risk he takes if he drinks too much.  Show him you have
      confidence in his power to stop or moderate.  Say you do not want to be a wet
      blanket; that you only want him to take care of his health.  Thus you may succeed
      in interesting him in alcoholism.\r\n    He probably has several alcoholics
      among his own acquaintances.  You might suggest that you both take an interest
      in them.  Drinkers like to help other drinkers.  Your husband may be willing
      to talk to one of them.\r\n    If this kind of approach does not catch your
      husband's interest, it may be best to drop the subject, but after a friendly
      talk your husband will usually revive the topic himself.  This may take patient
      waiting, but it will be worth it.  Meanwhile you might try to help the wife
      of another serious drinker.  If you act upon these principles, your husband
      may stop or moderate.\r\n    Suppose, however, that your husband fits the description
      of number two.  The same principles which apply to husband number one should
      be practiced.  But after his next binge, ask him if he would really like to
      get over drinking for good.  Do not ask that he do it for you or anyone else.
      \ Just would he like to?\r\n    The chances are he would.  Show him your copy
      of this book and tell him what you have found out about alcoholism.  Show him
      that as alcoholics, the writers of the book understand.  Tell him some of the
      interesting stories you have read.  If you think he will be shy of a spiritual
      remedy, ask him to look at the chapter on alcoholism.  Then perhaps he will
      be interested enough to continue.\r\n    If he is enthusiastic your cooperation
      will mean a great deal.  If he is lukewarm or thinks he is not an alcoholic,
      we suggest you leave him alone.  Avoid urging him to follow our program.  The
      seed has been planted in his mind.  He knows that thousands of men, much like
      himself, have recovered.  But don't remind him of this after he had been drinking,
      for he may be angry.  Sooner or later, you are likely to find him reading the
      book once more.  Wait until repeated stumbling convinces him he must act, for
      the more you hurry him the longer his recovery may be delayed.\r\n    If you
      have a number three husband, you may be in luck.  Being certain he wants to
      stop, you can go to him with this volume as joyfully as though you had struck
      oil.  He may not share your enthusiasm, but he is practically sure to read the
      book and he may go for the program at once.  If he does not, you will probably
      not have long to wait.  Again, you should not crowd him.  Let him decide for
      himself.  Cheerfully see him through more sprees.  Talk about his condition
      or this book only when he raises the issue.  In some cases it may be better
      to let someone outside the family present the book.  They can urge action without
      arousing hostility.  If your husband is otherwise a normal individual, your
      chances are good at this stage.\r\n    You would suppose that men in the fourth
      classification would be quite hopeless, but that is not so.  Many of Alcoholics
      Anonymous were like that.  Everybody had given them up.  Defeat seemed certain.
      \ Yet often such men had spectacular and powerful recoveries.\r\n    There are
      exceptions.  Some men have been so impaired by alcohol that they cannot stop.
      \ Sometimes there are cases where alcoholism is complicated by other disorders.
      \ A good doctor or psychiatrist can tell you whether these complications are
      serious.  In any event, try to have your husband read this book.  His reaction
      may be one of enthusiasm.  If he is already committed to an institution, but
      can convince you and your doctor that he means business, give him a chance to
      try our method, unless the doctor thinks his mental condition too abnormal or
      dangerous.  We make this recommendation with some confidence.  For years we
      have been working with alcoholics committed to institutions.  Since this book
      was first published, A.A. has released thousands of alcoholics from asylums
      and hospitals of every kind.  The majority have never returned.  The power of
      God goes deep!\r\n    You may have the reverse situation on your hands.  Perhaps
      you have a husband who is at large, but who should be committed.  Some men cannot
      or will not get over alcoholism.  When they become too dangerous, we think the
      kind thing is to lock them up, but of course a good doctor should always be
      consulted.  The wives and children of such men suffer horribly, but not more
      than the men themselves.\r\n    But sometimes you must start life anew.  We
      know women who have done it.  If such women adopt a spiritual way of life their
      road will be smoother.\r\n    If your husband is a drinker, you probably worry
      over what other people are thinking and you hate to meet your friends.  You
      draw more and more into yourself and you think everyone is talking about conditions
      at your home.  You avoid the subject of drinking, even with your own parents.
      \ You do not know what to tell the children.  When your husband is bad, you
      become a trembling recluse, wishing the telephone had never been invented.\r\n
      \   We find that most of this embarrassment is unnecessary.  While you need
      not discuss your husband at length, you can quietly let your friends know the
      nature of his illness.  But you must be on guard not to embarrass or harm your
      husband.\r\n    When you have carefully explained to such people that he is
      a sick person, you will have created a new atmosphere.  Barriers which have
      sprung up between you and your friends will disappear with the growth of sympathetic
      understanding.  You will no longer be self-conscious or feel that you must apologize
      as though your husband were a weak character.  He may be anything but that.
      \ Your new courage, good nature and lack of self-consciousness will do wonders
      for you socially.\r\n    The same principle applies in dealing with the children.
      \ Unless they actually need protection from their father, it is best not to
      take sides in any argument he has with them while drinking.  Use your energies
      to promote a better understanding all around.  Then that terrible tension which
      grips the home of every problem drinker will be lessened.\r\n    Frequently,
      you have felt obliged to tell your husband's employer and his friends that he
      was sick, when as a matter of fact he was tight.  Avoid answering these inquiries
      as much as you can.  Whenever possible, let your husband explain.  Your desire
      to protect him should not cause you to lie to people when they have a right
      to know were he is and what he is doing.  Discuss this with him when he is sober
      and in good spirits.  Ask him what you should do if he places you in such a
      position again.  But be careful not to be resentful about the last time he did
      so.\r\n    There is another paralyzing fear.  You may be afraid your husband
      will lose his position; you are thinking of the disgrace and hard times which
      will befall you and the children.  This experience may come to you.  Or you
      may already have had it several times.  Should it happen again, regard it in
      a different light.  Maybe it will prove a blessing!  It may convince your husband
      he wants to stop drinking forever.  And now you know that he can stop if he
      will!  Time after time, this apparent calamity has been a boon to us, for it
      opened up a path which led to the discovery of God.\r\n    We have elsewhere
      remarked how much better life is when lived on a spiritual plane.  If God can
      solve the age-old riddle of alcoholism, He can solve your problems too.  We
      wives found that, like everybody else, we were afflicted with pride, self-pity,
      vanity and all the things which go to make up the self-centered person; and
      we were not above selfishness or dishonesty.  As our husbands began to apply
      spiritual principles in their lives, we began to see the desirability of doing
      so too.\r\n    At first, some of us did not believe we needed this help.  We
      thought, on the whole, we were pretty good women, capable of being nicer if
      our husbands stopped drinking.  But it was a silly idea that we were too good
      to need God.  Now we try to put spiritual principles to work in every department
      of our lives.  When we do that, we find it solves our problems too; the ensuing
      lack of fear, worry and hurt feelings is a wonderful thing.  We urge you to
      try our program, for nothing will be so helpful to your husband as the radically
      changed attitude toward him which God will show you how to have.  Go along with
      your husband if you possibly can.\r\n    If you and your husband find a solution
      for the pressing problem of drink you are, of course, going to be very happy.
      \ But all problems will not be solved at once.  Seed has started to sprout in
      a new soil, but growth has only begun.  In spite of your new-found happiness,
      there will be ups and downs.  Many of the old problems will still be with you.
      \ This is as it should be.  \r\n    The faith and sincerity of both you and
      your husband will be put to the test.  These work-outs should be regarded as
      part of your education, for thus you will be learning to live.  You will make
      mistakes, but if you are in earnest they will not drag you down.  Instead, you
      will capitalize them.  A better way of life will emerge when they are overcome.\r\n
      \   Some of the snags you will encounter are irritation, hurt feelings and resentments.
      \ Your husband will sometimes be unreasonable and you will want to criticize.
      \ Starting from a speck on the domestic horizon, great thunderclouds of dispute
      may gather.  These family dissensions are very dangerous, especially to your
      husband.  Often you must carry the burden of avoiding them or keeping them under
      control.  Never forget that resentment is a deadly hazard to an alcoholic.  We
      do not mean that you have to agree with your husband whenever there is an honest
      difference of opinion.  Just be careful not to disagree in a resentful or critical
      spirit.\r\n    You and your husband will find that you can dispose of serious
      problems easier than you can the trivial ones.  Next time you and he have a
      heated discussion, no matter what the subject, it should be the privilege of
      either to smile and say, 'This is getting serious.  I'm sorry I got disturbed.
      \ Let's talk about it later.'  If your husband is trying to live on a spiritual
      basis, he will also be doing everything in his power to avoid disagreement or
      contention.\r\n    Your husband knows he owes you more than sobriety.  He wants
      to make good.  Yet you must not expect too much.  His ways of thinking and doing
      are the habits of years.  Patience, tolerance, understanding and love are the
      watchwords.  Show him these things in yourself and they will be reflected back
      to you from him.  Live and let live is the rule.  If you both show a willingness
      to remedy your own defects, there will be little need to criticize each other.\r\n
      \   We women carry with us a picture of the ideal man, the sort of chap we would
      like our husbands to be.  It is the most natural thing in the world, once his
      liquor problem is solved, to feel that he will now measure up to that cherished
      vision.  The chances are he will not for, like yourself, he is just beginning
      his development.  Be patient.\r\n    Another feeling we are very likely to entertain
      is one of resentment that love and loyalty could not cure our husbands of alcoholism.
      \ We do not like the thought that the contents of a book or the work of another
      alcoholic has accomplished in a few weeks that for which we struggled for years.
      \ At such moments we forget that alcoholism is an illness over which we could
      not possibly have had any power.  Your husband will be the first to say it was
      your devotion and care which brought him to the point where he could have a
      spiritual experience.  Without you he would have gone to pieces long ago.  When
      resentful thoughts come, try to pause and count your blessings.  After all,
      your family is reunited, alcohol is no longer a problem and you and your husband
      are working together toward an undreamed-of future.\r\n    Still another difficulty
      is that you may become jealous of the attention he bestows on other people,
      especially alcoholics.  You have been starving for his companionship, yet he
      spends long hours helping other men and their families.  You feel he should
      now be yours.  The fact is that he should work with other people to maintain
      his own sobriety.  Sometimes he will be so interested that he becomes really
      neglectful.  Your house is filled with strangers.  You may not like some of
      them.  He gets stirred up about their troubles, but not at all about yours.
      \ It will do little good if you point that out and urge more attention for yourself.
      \ We find it a real mistake to dampen his enthusiasm for alcoholic work.  You
      should join in his efforts as much as you possibly can.  We suggest that you
      direct some of your thought to the wives of his new alcoholic friends.  They
      need the counsel and love of a woman who has gone through what you have.\r\n
      \   It is probably true that you and your husband have been living too much
      alone, for drinking many times isolates the wife of an alcoholic.  Therefore,
      you probably need fresh interests and a great cause to live for as much as your
      husband.  If you cooperate, rather than complain, you will find that his excess
      enthusiasm will tone down.  Both of you will awaken to a new sense of responsibility
      for others. You, as well as your husband, ought to think of what you can put
      into life instead of how much you can take out.  Inevitably your lives will
      be fuller for doing so.  You will lose the old life to find one much better.\r\n
      \   Perhaps your husband will make a fair start on the new basis, but just as
      things are going beautifully he dismays you by coming home drunk.  If you are
      satisfied he really wants to get over drinking, you need not be alarmed.  Though
      it is infinitely better that he have no relapse at all, as has been true with
      many of our men, it is by no means a bad thing in some cases.  Your husband
      will see at once that he must redouble his spiritual activities if he expects
      to survive.  You need not remind him of his spiritual deficiency-he will know
      of it.  Cheer him up and ask him how you can be still more helpful.\r\n    The
      slightest sign of fear or intolerance may lessen your husband's chance of recovery.
      \ In a weak moment he may take your dislike of his high-stepping friends as
      one of those insanely trivial excuses to drink.\r\n    We never, never try to
      arrange a man's life so as to shield him from temptation.  The slightest disposition
      on your part to guide his appointments or his affairs so he will not be tempted
      will be noticed.  Make him feel absolutely free to come and go as he likes.
      \ This is important.  If he gets drunk, don't blame yourself.  God has either
      removed your husband's liquor problem or He has not.  If not, it had better
      be found out right away.  Then you and your husband can get right down to fundamentals.
      \ If a repetition is to be prevented, place the problem, along with everything
      else, in God's hands.\r\n    We realize that we have been giving you much direction
      and advice.  We may have seemed to lecture.  If that is so we are sorry, for
      we ourselves don't always care for people who lecture us.  But what we have
      related is based upon experience, some of it painful.  We had to learn these
      things the hard way.  That is why we are anxious that you understand, and that
      you avoid these unnecessary difficulties. \r\n    So to you out there-who may
      soon be with us-we say 'Good luck and God bless you!'"

    - THE FAMILY AFTERWARD
    - "OUR WOMEN FOLK have suggested certain attitudes a wife may take with the husband
      who is recovering.  Perhaps they created the impression that he is to be wrapped
      in cotton wool and placed on a pedestal.  Successful readjustment means the
      opposite.  All members of the family should meet upon the common ground of tolerance,
      understanding and love.  This involves a process of deflation.  The alcoholic,
      his wife, his children, his 'in-laws,' each one is likely to have fixed ideas
      about the family's attitude towards himself or herself.  Each is interested
      in having his or her wishes respected.  We find the more one member of the family
      demands that the others concede to him, the more resentful they become.  This
      makes for discord and unhappiness.\r\n    And why?  Is it not because each wants
      to play the lead?  Is not each trying to arrange the family show to his liking?
      \ Is he not unconsciously trying to see what he can take from the family life
      rather than give?\r\n    Cessation of drinking is but the first step away from
      a highly strained, abnormal condition.  A doctor said to us, 'Years of living
      with an alcoholic is almost sure to make any wife or child neurotic.  The entire
      family is, to some extent, ill.'  Let families realize, as they start their
      journey, that all will not be fair weather.  Each in his turn may be footsore
      and may straggle.  There will be alluring shortcuts and by-paths down which
      they may wander and lose their way.\r\n    Suppose we tell you some of the obstacles
      a family will meet; suppose we suggest how they may be avoided-even converted
      to good use for others.  The family of an alcoholic longs for the return of
      happiness and security.  They remember when father was romantic, thoughtful
      and successful.  Today's life is measured against that of other years and, when
      it falls short, the family may be unhappy.\r\n    Family confidence in dad is
      rising high.  The good old days will soon be back, they think.  Sometimes they
      demand that dad bring them back instantly!  God, they believe, almost owes this
      recompense on a long overdue account.  But the head of the house has spent years
      in pulling down the structures of business, romance, friendship, health-these
      things are now ruined or damaged.  It will take time to clear away the wreck.
      \ Though old buildings will eventually be replaced by finer ones, the new structures
      will take years to complete.\r\n    Father knows he is to blame; it may take
      him many seasons of hard work to be restored financially, but he shouldn't be
      reproached.  Perhaps he will never have much money again.  But the wise family
      will admire him for what he is trying to be, rather than for what he is trying
      to get.\r\n    Now and then the family will be plagued by spectres from the
      past, for the drinking career of almost every alcoholic has been marked by escapades,
      funny, humiliating, shameful or tragic.  The first impulse will be to bury these
      skeletons in a dark closet and padlock the door.  The family may be possessed
      by the idea that future happiness can be based only upon forgetfulness of the
      past.  We think that such a view is self-centered and in direct conflict with
      the new way of living.\r\n    Henry Ford once made a wise remark to the effect
      that experience is the thing of supreme value in life.  That is true only if
      one is willing to turn the past to good account.  We grow by our willingness
      to face and rectify errors and convert them into assets.  The alcoholic's past
      thus becomes the principal asset of the family and frequently it is almost the
      only one!\r\n    This painful past may be of infinite value to other families
      still struggling with their problem.  We think each family which has been relieved
      owes something to those who have not, and when the occasion requires, each member
      of it should be only too willing to bring former mistakes, no matter how grievous,
      out of their hiding places.  Showing others who suffer how we were given help
      is the very thing which makes life seem so worth while to us now.  Cling to
      the thought that, in God's hands, the dark past is the greatest possession you
      have-the key to life and happiness for others.  With it you can avert death
      and misery for them.\r\n    It is possible to dig up past misdeeds so they become
      a blight, a veritable plague.  For example, we know of situations in which the
      alcoholic or his wife have had love affairs.  In the first flush of spiritual
      experience they forgave each other and drew closer together.  The miracle of
      reconciliation was at hand.  Then, under one provocation or another, the aggrieved
      one would unearth the old affair and angrily cast its ashes about.  A few of
      us have had these growing pains and they hurt a great deal.  Husbands and wives
      have sometimes been obliged to separate for a time until new perspective, new
      victory over hurt pride could be re-won.  In most cases, the alcoholic survived
      this ordeal without relapse, but not always.  So we think that unless some good
      and useful purpose is to be served, past occurrences should not be discussed.\r\n
      \   We families of Alcoholics Anonymous keep few skeletons in the closet.  Everyone
      knows about the others' alcoholic troubles.  This is a condition which, in ordinary
      life, would produce untold grief; there might be scandalous gossip, laughter
      at the expense of other people, and a tendency to take advantage of intimate
      information.  Among us, these are rare occurrences.  We do talk about each other
      a great deal, but we almost invariably temper such talk by a spirit of love
      and tolerance.\r\n    Another principle we observe carefully is that we do not
      relate intimate experiences of another person unless we are sure he would approve.
      \ We find it better, when possible, to stick to our own stories.  A man may
      criticize or laugh at himself and it will affect others favorably, but criticism
      or ridicule coming from another often produces the contrary effect.  Members
      of a family should watch such matters carefully, for one careless, inconsiderate
      remark has been known to raise the very devil.  We alcoholics are sensitive
      people.  It takes some of us a long time to outgrow that serious handicap.\r\n
      \   Many alcoholics are enthusiasts.  They run to extremes.  At the beginning
      of recovery a man will take, as a rule, one of two directions.  He may either
      plunge into a frantic attempt to get on his feet in business, or he may be so
      enthralled by his new life that he talks or thinks of little else.  In either
      case certain family problems will arise.  With these we have had experience
      galore.\r\n    We think it dangerous if he rushes headlong at his economic problem.
      \ The family will be affected also, pleasantly at first, as they feel their
      money troubles are about to be solved, then not so pleasantly as they find themselves
      neglected.  Dad may be tired at night and preoccupied by day.  He may take small
      interest in the children and may show irritation when reproved for his delinquencies.
      \ If not irritable, he may seem dull and boring, not gay and affectionate as
      the family would like him to be.  Mother may complain of inattention.  They
      are all disappointed, and often let him feel it.  Beginning with such complaints,
      a barrier arises.  He is straining every nerve to make up for lost time.  He
      is striving to recover fortune and reputation and feels he is doing very well.\r\n
      \   Sometimes mother and children don't think so.  Having been neglected and
      misused in the past, they think father owes them more than they are getting.
      \ They want him to make a fuss over them.  They expect him to give them the
      nice times they used to have before he drank so much, and to show his contrition
      for what they suffered.  But dad doesn't give freely of himself.  Resentment
      grows.  He becomes still less communicative.  Sometimes he explodes over a trifle.
      \ The family is mystified.  They criticize, pointing out how he is falling down
      on his spiritual program.\r\n    This sort of thing can be avoided.  Both father
      and the family are mistaken, though each side may have some justification.  It
      is of little use to argue and only makes the impasse worse.  The family must
      realize that dad, though marvelously improved, is still convalescing.  They
      should be thankful he is sober and able to be of this world once more.  Let
      them praise his progress.  Let them remember that his drinking wrought all kinds
      of damage that may take long to repair.  If they sense these things, they will
      not take so seriously his periods of crankiness, depression, or apathy, which
      will disappear when there is tolerance, love, and spiritual understanding.\r\n
      \   The head of the house ought to remember that he is mainly to blame for what
      befell his home.  He can scarcely square the account in his lifetime.  But he
      must see the danger of over-concentration on financial success.  Although financial
      recovery is on the way for many of us, we found we could not place money first.
      \ For us, material well-being always followed spiritual progress; it never preceded.\r\n
      \   Since the home has suffered more than anything else, it is well that a man
      exert himself there.  He is not likely to get far in any direction if he fails
      to show unselfishness and love under his own roof.  We know there are difficult
      wives and families, but the man who is getting over alcoholism must remember
      he did much to make them so.\r\n    As each member of a resentful family begins
      to see his shortcomings and admits them to the others, he lays a basis for helpful
      discussion.  These family talks will be constructive if they can be carried
      on without heated argument, self-pity, self-justification or resentful criticism.
      \ Little by little, mother and children will see they ask too much, and father
      will see he gives too little.  Giving, rather than getting, will become the
      guiding principle.\r\n    Assume on the other hand that father has, at the outset,
      a stirring spiritual experience.  Overnight, as it were, he is a different man.
      \ He becomes a religious enthusiast.  He is unable to focus on anything else.
      \ As soon as his sobriety begins to be taken as a matter of course, the family
      may look at their strange new dad with apprehension, then with irritation.  There
      is talk about spiritual matters morning, noon and night.  He may demand that
      the family find God in a hurry, or exhibit amazing indifference to them and
      say he is above worldly considerations.  He may tell mother, who has been religious
      all her life, that she doesn't know what it's all about, and that she had better
      get his brand of spirituality while there is yet time.\r\n    When father takes
      this tack, the family may react unfavorably.  They may be jealous of a God who
      has stolen dad's affections.  While grateful that he drinks no more, they may
      not like the idea that God has accomplished the miracle where they failed.  They
      often forget father was beyond human aid.  They may not see why their love and
      devotion did not straighten him out.  Dad is not so spiritual after all, they
      say.  If he means to right his past wrongs, why all this concern for everyone
      in the world but his family?  What about his talk that God will take care of
      them?  They suspect father is a bit balmy!\r\n    He is not so unbalanced as
      they might think.  Many of us have experienced dad's elation.  We have indulged
      in spiritual intoxication.  Like a gaunt prospector, belt drawn in over the
      last ounce of food, our pick struck gold.  Joy at our release from a lifetime
      of frustration knew no bounds.  Father feels he has struck something better
      than gold.  For a time he may try to hug the new treasure to himself.  He may
      not see at once that he has barely scratched a limitless lode which will pay
      dividends only if he mines it for the rest of his life and insists on giving
      away the entire product. \r\n    If the family cooperates, dad will soon see
      that he is suffering from a distortion of values.  He will perceive that his
      spiritual growth is lopsided, that for an average man like himself, a spiritual
      life which does not include his family obligations may not be so perfect after
      all.  If the family will appreciate that dad's current behavior is but a phase
      of his development, all will be well.  In the midst of an understanding and
      sympathetic family, these vagaries of dad's spiritual infancy will quickly disappear.\r\n
      \   The opposite may happen should the family condemn and criticize.  Dad may
      feel that for years his drinking has placed him on the wrong side of every argument,
      but that now he has become a superior person with God on his side.  If the family
      persists in criticism, this fallacy may take a still greater hold on father.
      \ Instead of treating the family as he should, he may retreat further into himself
      and feel he has spiritual justification for so doing.\r\n    Though the family
      does not fully agree with dad's spiritual activities, they should let him have
      his head.  Even if he displays a certain amount of neglect and irresponsibility
      towards the family, it is well to let him go as far as he likes in helping other
      alcoholics.  During those first days of convalescence, this will do more to
      insure his sobriety than anything else.  Though some of his manifestations are
      alarming and disagreeable, we think dad will be on a firmer foundation than
      the man who is placing business or professional success ahead of spiritual development.
      \ He will be less likely to drink again, and anything is preferable to that.\r\n
      \   Those of us who have spent much time in the world of spiritual make-believe
      have eventually seen the childishness of it.  This dream world has been replaced
      by a great sense of purpose, accompanied by a growing consciousness of the power
      of God in our lives.  We have come to believe He would like us to keep our heads
      in the clouds with Him, but that our feet ought to be firmly planted on earth.
      \ That is where our fellow travelers are, and that is where our work must be
      done.  These are the realities for us.  We have found nothing incompatible between
      a powerful spiritual experience and a life of sane and happy usefulness.\r\n
      \   One more suggestion:  Whether the family has spiritual convictions or not,
      they may do well to examine the principles by which the alcoholic member is
      trying to live.  They can hardly fail to approve these simple principles, though
      the head of the house still fails somewhat in practicing them.  Nothing will
      help the man who is off on a spiritual tangent so much as the wife who adopts
      a sane spiritual program, making a better practical use of it.\r\n    There
      will be other profound changes in the household.  Liquor incapacitated father
      for so many years that mother became head of the house.  She met these responsibilities
      gallantly.  By force of circumstances, she was often obliged to treat father
      as a sick or wayward child.  Even when he wanted to assert himself he could
      not, for his drinking placed him constantly in the wrong.  Mother made all the
      plans and gave the directions.  When sober, father usually obeyed.  Thus mother,
      through no fault of her own, became accustomed to wearing the family trousers.
      \ Father, coming suddenly to life again, often begins to assert himself.  This
      means trouble, unless the family watches for these tendencies in each other
      and comes to a friendly agreement about them.\r\n    Drinking isolates most
      homes from the outside world.  Father may have laid aside for years all normal
      activities-clubs, civic duties, sports.  When he renews interest in such things,
      a feeling of jealousy may arise.  The family may feel they hold a mortgage on
      dad, so big that no equity should be left for outsiders.  Instead of developing
      new channels of activity for themselves, mother and children demand that he
      stay home and make up the deficiency.\r\n    At the very beginning, the couple
      ought to frankly face the fact that each will have to yield here and there if
      the family is going to play an effective part in the new life.  Father will
      necessarily spend much time with other alcoholics, but this activity should
      be balanced.  New acquaintances who know nothing of alcoholism might be made
      and thoughtful consideration given their needs.  The problems of the community
      might engage attention.  Though the family has no religious connections, they
      may wish to make contact with or take membership in a religious body.\r\n    Alcoholics
      who have derided religious people will be helped by such contacts.  Being possessed
      of a spiritual experience, the alcoholic will find he has much in common with
      these people, though he may differ with them on many matters.  If he does not
      argue about religion, he will make new friends and is sure to find new avenues
      of usefulness and pleasure.  He and his family can be a bright spot in such
      congregations.  He may bring new hope and new courage to many a priest, minister,
      or rabbi, who gives his all to minister to our troubled world.  We intend the
      foregoing as a helpful suggestion only.  So far as we are concerned, there is
      nothing obligatory about it.  As non-denominational people, we cannot make up
      others' minds for them.  Each individual should consult his own conscience.\r\n
      \   We have been speaking to you of serious, sometimes tragic things.  We have
      been dealing with alcohol in its worst aspect.  But we aren't a glum lot.  If
      newcomers could see no joy or fun in our existence, they wouldn't want it.  We
      absolutely insist on enjoying life.  We try not to indulge in cynicism over
      the state of the nations, nor do we carry the world's troubles on our shoulders.
      \ When we see a man sinking into the mire that is alcoholism, we give him first
      aid and place what we have at his disposal.  For his sake, we do recount and
      almost relive the horrors of our past.  But those of us who have tried to shoulder
      the entire burden and trouble of others find we are soon overcome by them.\r\n
      \   So we think cheerfulness and laughter make for usefulness.  Outsiders are
      sometimes shocked when we burst into merriment over a seemingly tragic experience
      out of the past.  But why shouldn't we laugh?  We have recovered, and have been
      given the power to help others.\r\n    Everybody knows that those in bad health,
      and those who seldom play, do not laugh much.  So let each family play together
      or separately, as much as their circumstances warrant.  We are sure God wants
      us to be happy, joyous, and free.  We cannot subscribe to the belief that this
      life is a vale of tears, though it once was just that for many of us.  But it
      is clear that we made our own misery.  God didn't do it.  Avoid then, the deliberate
      manufacture of misery, but if trouble comes, cheerfully capitalize it as an
      opportunity to demonstrate His omnipotence.\r\n    Now about health:  A body
      badly burned by alcohol does not often recover overnight nor do twisted thinking
      and depression vanish in a twinkling.  We are convinced that a spiritual mode
      of living is a most powerful health restorative.  We, who have recovered from
      serious drinking, are miracles of mental health.  But we have seen remarkable
      transformations in our bodies.  Hardly one of our crowd now shows any mark of
      dissipation.\r\n    But this does not mean that we disregard human health measures.
      \ God has abundantly supplied this world with fine doctors, psychologists, and
      practitioners of various kinds.  Do not hesitate to take your health problems
      to such persons.  Most of them give freely of themselves, that their fellows
      may enjoy sound minds and bodies.  Try to remember that though God has wrought
      miracles among us, we should never belittle a good doctor or psychiatrist.  Their
      services are often indispensable in treating a newcomer and in following his
      case afterward.\r\n    One of the many doctors who had the opportunity of reading
      this book in manuscript form told us that the use of sweets was often helpful,
      of course depending upon a doctor's advice.  He thought all alcoholics should
      constantly have chocolate available for its quick energy value at times of fatigue.
      \ He added that occasionally in the night a vague craving arose which would
      be satisfied by candy.  Many of us have noticed a tendency to eat sweets and
      have found this practice beneficial.\r\n    A word about sex relations.  Alcohol
      is so sexually stimulating to some men that they have over-indulged.  Couples
      are occasionally dismayed to find that when drinking is stopped the man tends
      to be impotent.  Unless the reason is understood, there may be an emotional
      upset.  Some of us had this experience, only to enjoy, in a few months, a finer
      intimacy than ever.  There should be no hesitancy in consulting a doctor or
      psychologist if the condition persists.  We do not know of many cases where
      this difficulty lasted long.\r\n    The alcoholic may find it hard to re-establish
      friendly relations with his children.  Their young minds were impressionable
      while he was drinking.  Without saying so, they may cordially hate him for what
      he has done to them and to their mother.  The children are sometimes dominated
      by a pathetic hardness and cynicism.  They cannot seem to forgive and forget.
      This may hang on for months, long after their mother has accepted dad's new
      way of living and thinking.\r\n    In time they will see that he is a new man
      and in their own way they will let him know it.  When this happens, they can
      be invited to join in morning meditation and then they can take part in the
      daily discussion without rancor or bias.  From that point on, progress will
      be rapid.  Marvelous results often follow such a reunion.\r\n    Whether the
      family goes on a spiritual basis or not, the alcoholic member has to if he would
      recover.  The others must be convinced of his new status beyond the shadow of
      a doubt.  Seeing is believing to most families who have lived with a drinker.\r\n
      \   Here is a case in point:  One of our friends is a heavy smoker and coffee
      drinker.  There was no doubt he over-indulged.  Seeing this, and meaning to
      be helpful, his wife commenced to admonish him about it.  He admitted he was
      overdoing these things, but frankly said that he was not ready to stop.  His
      wife is one of those persons who really feels there is something rather sinful
      about these commodities, so she nagged, and her intolerance finally threw him
      into a fit of anger.  He got drunk.\r\n    Of course our friend was wrong-dead
      wrong.  He had to painfully admit that and mend his spiritual fences.  Though
      he is now a most effective member of Alcoholics Anonymous, he still smokes and
      drinks coffee, but neither his wife nor anyone else stands in judgment.  She
      sees she was wrong to make a burning issue out of such a matter when his more
      serious ailments were being rapidly cured.\r\n    We have three little mottoes
      which are apropos.  Here they are:\r\n    First Things First\r\n    Live and
      Let Live\r\n    Easy Does It."

    - TO EMPLOYERS
    - "AMONG MANY employers nowadays, we think of one member who has spent much of
      his life in the world of big business.  He has hired and fired hundreds of men.
      \ He knows the alcoholic as the employer sees him.  His present views ought
      to prove exceptionally useful to business men everywhere. \r\n    But let him
      tell you:\r\n    I was at one time assistant manager of a corporation department
      employing sixty-six hundred men.  One day my secretary came in saying that Mr.
      B- insisted on speaking with me.  I told her to say that I was not interested.
      \ I had warned him several times that he had but one more chance.  Not long
      afterward he had called me from Hartford on two successive days, so drunk he
      could hardly speak.  I told him he was through-finally and forever.\r\n    My
      secretary returned to say that it was not Mr. B- on the phone; it was Mr. B-'s
      brother, and he wished to give me a message.  I still expected a plea for clemency,
      but these words came through the receiver:  'I just wanted to tell you Paul
      jumped from a hotel window in Hartford last Saturday.  He left us a note saying
      you were the best boss he ever had, and that you were not to blame in any way.'\r\n
      \   Another time, as I opened a letter which lay on my desk, a newspaper clipping
      fell out.  It was the obituary of one of the best salesmen I ever had.  After
      two weeks of drinking, he had placed his toe on the trigger of a loaded shotgun-the
      barrel was in his mouth.  I had discharged him for drinking six weeks before.\r\n
      \   Still another experience:  A woman's voice came faintly over long distance
      from Virginia.  She wanted to know if her husband's company insurance was still
      in force.  Four days before he had hanged himself in his woodshed.  I had been
      obliged to discharge him for drinking, though he was brilliant, alert, and one
      of the best organizers I have ever known.\r\n    Here were three exceptional
      men lost to this world because I did not understand alcoholism as I do now.
      \ What irony-I became an alcoholic myself!  And but for the intervention of
      an understanding person, I might have followed in their footsteps.  My downfall
      cost the business community unknown thousands of dollars, for it takes real
      money to train a man for an executive position.  This kind of waste goes on
      unabated.  We think the business fabric is shot through with a situation which
      might be helped by better understanding all around. \r\n    Nearly every modern
      employer feels a moral responsibility for the well-being of his help, and he
      tries to meet these responsibilities.  That he has not always done so for the
      alcoholic is easily understood.  To him the alcoholic has often seemed a fool
      of the first magnitude.  Because of the employee's special ability, or of his
      own strong personal attachment to him, the employer has sometimes kept such
      a man at work long beyond a reasonable period.  Some employers have tried every
      known remedy.  In only a few instances has there been a lack of patience and
      tolerance.  And we, who have imposed on the best of employers, can scarcely
      blame them if they have been short with us.\r\n    Here, for instance, is a
      typical example:  An officer of one of the largest banking institutions in America
      knows I no longer drink.  One day he told me about an executive of the same
      bank who, from his description, was undoubtedly alcoholic.  This seemed to me
      like an opportunity to be helpful, so I spent two hours talking about alcoholism,
      the malady, and described the symptoms and results as well as I could.  His
      comment was, 'Very interesting.  But I'm sure this man is done drinking.  He
      has just returned from a three-months leave of absence, has taken a cure, looks
      fine, and to clinch the matter, the board of directors told him this was his
      last chance.'\r\n    The only answer I could make was that if the man followed
      the usual pattern, he would go on a bigger bust than ever.  I felt this was
      inevitable and wondered if the bank was doing the man an injustice.  Why not
      bring him into contact with some of our alcoholic crowd?  He might have a chance.
      \ I pointed out that I had had nothing to drink whatever for three years, and
      this in the face of difficulties that would have made nine out of ten men drink
      their heads off.  Why not at least afford him an opportunity to hear my story?
      \ 'Oh no,' said my friend, 'this chap is either through with liquor, or he is
      minus a job.  If he has your will power and guts, he will make the grade.'\r\n
      \   I wanted to throw up my hands in discouragement, for I saw that I had failed
      to help my banker friend understand.  He simply could not believe that his brother-executive
      suffered from a serious illness.  There was nothing to do but wait.\r\n    Presently
      the man did slip and was fired.  Following his discharge, we contacted him.
      \ Without much ado, he accepted the principles and procedure that had helped
      us.  He is undoubtedly on the road to recovery.  To me, this incident illustrates
      lack of understanding as to what really ails the alcoholic, and lack of knowledge
      as to what part employers might profitably take in salvaging their sick employees.\r\n
      \   If you desire to help it might be well to disregard your own drinking, or
      lack of it.  Whether you are a hard drinker, a moderate drinker or a teetotaler,
      you may have some pretty strong opinions, perhaps prejudices.  Those who drink
      moderately may be more annoyed with an alcoholic than a total abstainer would
      be.  Drinking occasionally, and understanding your own reactions, it is possible
      for you to become quite sure of many things which, so far as the alcoholic is
      concerned, are not always so.  As a moderate drinker, you can take your liquor
      or leave it alone.  Whenever you want to, you control your drinking.  Of an
      evening, you can go on a mild bender, get up in the morning, shake your head
      and go to business.  To you, liquor is no real problem.  You cannot see why
      it should be to anyone else, save the spineless and stupid.\r\n    When dealing
      with an alcoholic, there may be a natural annoyance that a man could be so weak,
      stupid and irresponsible.  Even when you understand the malady better, you may
      feel this feeling rising.\r\n    A look at the alcoholic in your organization
      is many times illuminating.  Is he not usually brilliant, fast-thinking, imaginative
      and likeable?  When sober, does he not work hard and have a knack of getting
      things done?  If he had these qualities and did not drink would he be worth
      retaining?  Should he have the same consideration as other ailing employees?
      \ Is he worth salvaging?  If your decision is yes, whether the reason be humanitarian
      or business or both, then the following suggestions may be helpful.\r\n    Can
      you discard the feeling that you are dealing only with habit, with stubbornness,
      or a weak will?  If this presents difficulty, re-reading chapters two and three,
      where the alcoholic sickness is discussed at length might be worth while. You,
      as a business man, want to know the necessities before considering the result.
      \ If you concede that your employee is ill, can he be forgiven for what he has
      done in the past?  Can his past absurdities be forgotten?  Can it be appreciated
      that he has been a victim of crooked thinking, directly caused by the action
      of alcohol on his brain?\r\n    I well remember the shock I received when a
      prominent doctor in Chicago told me of cases where pressure of the spinal fluid
      actually ruptured the brain.  No wonder an alcoholic is strangely irrational.
      \ Who wouldn't be, with such a fevered brain?  Normal drinkers are not so affected,
      nor can they understand the aberrations of the alcoholic.\r\n    Your man has
      probably been trying to conceal a number of scrapes, perhaps pretty messy ones.
      \ They may be disgusting.  You may be at a loss to understand how such a seemingly
      above-board chap could be so involved.  But these scrapes can generally be charged,
      no matter how bad, to the abnormal action of alcohol on his mind.  When drinking,
      or getting over a bout, an alcoholic, sometimes the model of honesty when normal,
      will do incredible things.  Afterward, his revulsion will be terrible.  Nearly
      always, these antics indicate nothing more than temporary conditions.\r\n    This
      is not to say that all alcoholics are honest and upright when not drinking.
      \ Of course that isn't so, and such people often may impose on you.  Seeing
      your attempt to understand and help, some men will try to take advantage of
      your kindness.  If you are sure your man does not want to stop, he may as well
      be discharged, the sooner the better.  You are not doing him a favor by keeping
      him on.  Firing such an individual may prove a blessing to him.  It may be just
      the jolt he needs.  I know, in my own particular case, that nothing my company
      could have done would have stopped me for, so long as I was able to hold my
      position, I could not possibly realize how serious my situation was.  Had they
      fired me first, and had they then taken steps to see that I was presented with
      the solution contained in this book, I might have returned to them six months
      later, a well man.\r\n    But there are many men who want to stop, and with
      them you can go far.  Your understanding treatment of their cases will pay dividends.\r\n
      \   Perhaps you have such a man in mind.  He wants to quit drinking and you
      want to help him, even if it be only a matter of good business.  You now know
      more about alcoholism.  You can see that he is mentally and physically sick.
      \ You are willing to overlook his past performances.  Suppose an approach is
      made something like this:\r\n    State that you know about his drinking, and
      that it must stop.  You might say you appreciate his abilities, would like to
      keep him, but cannot if he continues to drink.  A firm attitude at this point
      has helped many of us.\r\n    Next he can be assured that you do not intend
      to lecture, moralize, or condemn; that if this was done formerly, it was because
      of misunderstanding.  If possible express a lack of hard feeling toward him.
      \ At this point, it might be well to explain alcoholism, the illness.  Say that
      you believe he is a gravely ill person, with this qualification-being perhaps
      fatally ill, does he want to get well?  You ask, because many alcoholics, being
      warped and drugged, do not want to quit.  But does he?  Will he take every necessary
      step, submit to anything to get well, to stop drinking forever?\r\n    If he
      says yes, does he really mean it, or down inside does he think he is fooling
      you, and that after rest and treatment he will be able to get away with a few
      drinks now and then?  We believe a man should be thoroughly probed on these
      points.  Be satisfied he is not deceiving himself or you.\r\n    Whether you
      mention this book is a matter for your discretion.  If he temporizes and still
      thinks he can ever drink again, even beer, he might as well be discharged after
      the next bender which, if an alcoholic, he is almost certain to have.  He should
      understand that emphatically.  Either you are dealing with a man who can and
      will get well or you are not.  If not, why waste time with him?  This may seem
      severe, but it is usually the best course.\r\n    After satisfying yourself
      that your man wants to recover and that he will go to any extreme to do so,
      you may suggest a definite course of action.  For most alcoholics who are drinking,
      or who are just getting over a spree, a certain amount of physical treatment
      is desirable, even imperative.  The matter of physical treatment should, of
      course, be referred to your own doctor.  Whatever the method, its object is
      to thoroughly clear mind and body of the effects of alcohol.  In competent hands,
      this seldom takes long nor is it very expensive.  Your man will fare better
      if placed in such physical condition that he can think straight and no longer
      craves liquor.  If you propose such a procedure to him, it may be necessary
      to advance the cost of treatment, but we believe it should be made plain that
      any expense will later be deducted from his pay.  It is better for him to feel
      fully responsible.\r\n    If your man accepts your offer, it should be pointed
      out that physical treatment is but a small part of the picture.  Though you
      are providing him with the best possible medical attention, he should understand
      that he must undergo a change of heart.  To get over drinking will require a
      transformation of thought and attitude.  We all had to place recovery above
      everything, for without recovery we would have lost both home and business.\r\n
      \   Can you have every confidence in his ability to recover?  While on the subject
      of confidence, can you adopt the attitude that so far as you are concerned this
      will be a strictly personal matter, that his alcoholic derelictions, the treatment
      about to be undertaken, will never be discussed without his consent?  It might
      be well to have a long chat with him on his return.\r\n    To return to the
      subject matter of this book:  It contains full suggestions by which the employee
      may solve his problem.  To you, some of the ideas which it contains are novel.
      \ Perhaps you are not quite in sympathy with the approach we suggest.  By no
      means do we offer it as the last word on this subject, but so far as we are
      concerned, it has worked with us.  After all, are you not looking for results
      rather than methods?  Whether your employee likes it or not, he will learn the
      grim truth about alcoholism.  That won't hurt him a bit, even though he does
      not go for this remedy.\r\n    We suggest you draw the book to the attention
      of the doctor who is to attend your patient during treatment.  If the book is
      read the moment the patient is able, while acutely depressed, realization of
      his condition may come to him.\r\n    We hope the doctor will tell the patient
      the truth about his condition, whatever that happens to be.  When the man is
      presented with this volume it is best that no one tell him he must abide by
      its suggestions.  The man must decide for himself.\r\n    You are betting, of
      course, that your changed attitude plus the contents of this book will turn
      the trick.  In some cases it will, and in others it may not.  But we think that
      if you persevere, the percentage of successes will gratify you.  As our work
      spreads and our numbers increase, we hope your employees may be put in personal
      contact with some of us.  Meanwhile, we are sure a great deal can be accomplished
      by the use of the book alone.\r\n    On your employee's return, talk with him.
      \ Ask him if he thinks he has the answer.  If he feels free to discuss his problems
      with you, if he knows you under-stand and will not be upset by anything he wishes
      to say, he will probably be off to a fast start.\r\n    In this connection,
      can you remain undisturbed if the man proceeds to tell you shocking things?
      \ He may, for example, reveal that he has padded his expense account or that
      he has planned to take your best customers away from you.  In fact, he may say
      almost anything if he has accepted our solution which, as you know, demands
      rigorous honesty.  Can you charge this off as you would a bad account and start
      fresh with him?  If he owes you money you may wish to make terms.\r\n    If
      he speaks of his home situation, you can undoubtedly make helpful suggestions.
      \ Can he talk frankly with you so long as he does not bear business tales or
      criticize his associates?  With this kind of employee such an attitude will
      command undying loyalty.\r\n    The greatest enemies of us alcoholics are resentment,
      jealousy, envy, frustration, and fear.  Wherever men are gathered together in
      business there will be rivalries and, arising out of these, a certain amount
      of office politics.  Sometimes we alcoholics have an idea that people are trying
      to pull us down.  Often this is not so at all.  But sometimes our drinking will
      be used politically.\r\n    One instance comes to mind in which a malicious
      individual was always making friendly little jokes about an alcoholic's drinking
      exploits.  In this way he was slyly carrying tales.  In another case, an alcoholic
      was sent to a hospital for treatment.  Only a few knew of it at first but, within
      a short time, it was billboarded throughout the entire company.  Naturally this
      sort of thing decreased the man's chance of recovery.  The employer can many
      times protect the victim from this kind of talk.  The employer cannot play favorites,
      but he can always defend a man from needless provocation and unfair criticism.\r\n
      \   As a class, alcoholics are energetic people.  They work hard and they play
      hard.  Your man should be on his mettle to make good.  Being somewhat weakened,
      and faced with physical and mental readjustment to a life which knows no alcohol,
      he may overdo.  You may have to curb his desire to work sixteen hours a day.
      \ You may need to encourage him to play once in a while.  He may wish to do
      a lot for other alcoholics and something of the sort may come up during business
      hours.  A reasonable amount of latitude will be helpful.  This work is necessary
      to maintain his sobriety.\r\n    After your man has gone along without drinking
      for a few months, you may be able to make use of his services with other employees
      who are giving you the alcoholic run-around-provided, of course, they are willing
      to have a third party in the picture.  An alcoholic who has recovered, but holds
      a relatively unimportant job, can talk to a man with a better position.  Being
      on a radically different basis of life, he will never take advantage of the
      situation.\r\n    Your man may be trusted.  Long experience with alcoholic excuses
      naturally arouses suspicion.  When his wife next calls saying he is sick, you
      might jump to the conclusion he is drunk.  If he is, and is still trying to
      recover, he will tell you about it even if it means the loss of his job.  For
      he knows he must be honest if he would live at all.  He will appreciate knowing
      you are not bothering your head about him, that you are not suspicious nor are
      you trying to run his life so he will be shielded from temptation to drink.
      \ If he is conscientiously following the program of recovery he can go anywhere
      your business may call him.\r\n    In case he does stumble, even once, you will
      have to decide whether to let him go.  If you are sure he doesn't mean business,
      there is no doubt you should discharge him.  If, on the contrary, you are sure
      he is doing his utmost, you may wish to give him another chance.  But you should
      feel under no obligation to keep him on, for your obligation has been well discharged
      already.\r\n    There is another thing you might wish to do.  If your organization
      is a large one, your junior executives might be provided with this book.  You
      might let them know you have no quarrel with the alcoholics of your organization.
      \ These juniors are often in a difficult position.  Men under them are frequently
      their friends.  So, for one reason or another, they cover these men, hoping
      matters will take a turn for the better.  They often jeopardize their own positions
      by trying to help serious drinkers who should have been fired long ago, or else
      given an opportunity to get well.\r\n    After reading this book, a junior executive
      can go to such a man and say approximately this, 'Look here, Ed.  Do you want
      to stop drinking or not?  You put me on the spot every time you get drunk.  It
      isn't fair to me or the firm.  I have been learning something about alcoholism.
      \ If you are an alcoholic, you are a mighty sick man.  You act like one.  The
      firm wants to help you get over it, and if you are interested, there is a way
      out.  If you take it, your past will be forgotten and the fact that you went
      away for treatment will not be mentioned.  But if you cannot or will not stop
      drinking, I think you ought to resign.'\r\n    Your junior executive may not
      agree with the contents of our book.  He need not, and often should not show
      it to his alcoholic prospect.  But at least he will understand the problem and
      will no longer be misled by ordinary promises.  He will be able to take a position
      with such a man which is eminently fair and square.  He will have no further
      reason for covering up an alcoholic employee.\r\n    It boils right down to
      this:  No man should be fired just because he is alcoholic.  If he wants to
      stop, he should be afforded a real chance.  If he cannot or does not want to
      stop, he should be discharged.  The exceptions are few.\r\n    We think this
      method of approach will accomplish several things.  It will permit the rehabilitation
      of good men.  At the same time you will feel no reluctance to rid yourself of
      those who cannot or will not stop.  Alcoholism may be causing your organization
      considerable damage in its waste of time, men and reputation.  We hope our suggestions
      will help you plug up this sometimes serious leak.  We think we are sensible
      when we urge that you stop this waste and give your worthwhile man a chance.\r\n
      \   The other day an approach was made to the vice president of a large industrial
      concern.  He remarked:  'I'm mighty glad you fellows got over your drinking.
      \ But the policy of this company is not to interfere with the habits of our
      employees.  If a man drinks so much that his job suffers, we fire him.  I don't
      see how you can be of any help to us for, as you see, we don't have any alcoholic
      problem.'  This same company spends millions for research every year.  Their
      cost of production is figured to a fine decimal point.  They have recreational
      facilities.  There is company insurance.  There is a real interest, both humanitarian
      and business, in the well-being of employees.  But alcoholism-well, they just
      don't believe they have it.\r\n    Perhaps this is a typical attitude.  We,
      who have collectively seen a great deal of business life, at least from the
      alcoholic angle, had to smile at this gentleman's sincere opinion.  He might
      be shocked if he knew how much alcoholism is costing his organization a year.
      \ That company may harbor many actual or potential alcoholics.  We believe that
      managers of large enterprises often have little idea how prevalent this problem
      is.  Even if you feel your organization has no alcoholic problem, it might pay
      to take another look down the line.  You may make some interesting discoveries.\r\n
      \   Of course, this chapter refers to alcoholics, sick people, deranged men.
      \ What our friend, the vice president, had in mind was the habitual or whoopee
      drinker.  As to them, his policy is undoubtedly sound, but he did not distinguish
      between such people and the alcoholic.\r\n    It is not to be expected that
      an alcoholic employee will receive a disproportionate amount of time and attention.
      \ He should not be made a favorite.  The right kind of man, the kind who recovers,
      will not want this sort of thing.  He will not impose.  Far from it.  He will
      work like the devil and thank you to his dying day.\r\n    Today I own a little
      company.  There are two alcoholic employees, who produce as much as five normal
      salesmen.  But why not?  They have a new attitude, and they have been saved
      from a living death.  I have enjoyed every moment spent in getting them straightened
      out."

    - A VISION FOR YOU
    - "FOR MOST normal folks, drinking means conviviality, companionship and colorful
      imagination.  It means release from care, boredom and worry.  It is joyous intimacy
      with friends and a feeling that life is good.  But not so with us in those last
      days of heavy drinking.  The old pleasures were gone.  They were but memories.
      \ Never could we recapture the great moments of the past.  There was an insistent
      yearning to enjoy life as we once did and a heartbreaking obsession that some
      new miracle of control would enable us to do it.  There was always one more
      attempt-and one more failure.\r\n    The less people tolerated us, the more
      we withdrew from society, from life itself.  As we became subjects of King Alcohol,
      shivering denizens of his mad realm, the chilling vapor that is loneliness settled
      down.  It thickened, ever becoming blacker.  Some of us sought out sordid places,
      hoping to find understanding companionship and approval.  Momentarily we did-then
      would come oblivion and the awful awakening to face the hideous Four Horsemen-Terror,
      Bewilderment, Frustration, Despair.  Unhappy drinkers who read this page will
      understand!\r\n    Now and then a serious drinker, being dry at the moment says,
      'I don't miss it at all.  Feel better.  Work better.  Having a better time.'
      \ As ex-problem drinkers, we smile at such a sally.  We know our friend is like
      a boy whistling in the dark to keep up his spirits.  He fools himself.  Inwardly
      he would give anything to take half a dozen drinks and get away with them.  He
      will presently try the old game again, for he isn't happy about his sobriety.
      \ He cannot picture life without alcohol.  Some day he will be unable to imagine
      life either with alcohol or without it.  Then he will know loneliness such as
      few do.  He will be at the jumping-off place.  He will wish for the end.\r\n
      \   We have shown how we got out from under.  You say, 'Yes, I'm willing.  But
      am I to be consigned to a life where I shall be stupid, boring and glum, like
      some righteous people I see?  I know I must get along without liquor, but how
      can I?  Have you a sufficient substitute?'\r\n    Yes, there is a substitute
      and it is vastly more than that.  It is a fellowship in Alcoholics Anonymous.
      \ There you will find release from care, boredom and worry.  Your imagination
      will be fired.  Life will mean something at last.  The most satisfactory years
      of your existence lie ahead.  Thus we find the fellowship, and so will you.\r\n
      \   'How is that to come about?' you ask.  'Where am I to find these people?'\r\n
      \   You are going to meet these new friends in your own community.  Near you,
      alcoholics are dying helplessly like people in a sinking ship.  If you live
      in a large place, there are hundreds.  High and low, rich and poor, these are
      future fellows of Alcoholics Anonymous.  Among them you will make lifelong friends.
      \ You will be bound to them with new and wonderful ties, for you will escape
      disaster together and you will commence shoulder to shoulder your common journey.
      \ Then you will know what it means to give of yourself that others may survive
      and rediscover life.  You will learn the full meaning of 'Love thy neighbor
      as thyself.'\r\n    It may seem incredible that these men are to become happy,
      respected, and useful once more.  How can they rise out of such misery, bad
      repute and hopelessness?  The practical answer is that since these things have
      happened among us, they can happen with you.  Should you wish them above all
      else, and be willing to make use of our experience, we are sure they will come.
      \ The age of miracles is still with us.  Our own recovery proves that!\r\n    Our
      hope is that when this chip of a book is launched on the world tide of alcoholism,
      defeated drinkers will seize upon it, to follow its suggestions.  Many, we are
      sure, will rise to their feet and march on.  They will approach still other
      sick ones and fellowships of Alcoholics Anonymous may spring up in each city
      and hamlet, havens for those who must find a way out.\r\n    In the chapter
      'Working With Others' you gathered an idea of how we approach and aid others
      to health.  Suppose now that through you several families have adopted this
      way of life.  You will want to know more of how to proceed from that point.
      \ Perhaps the best way of treating you to a glimpse of your future will be to
      describe the growth of the fellowship among us.  Here is a brief account:\r\n
      \   Years ago, in 1935, one of our number made a journey to a certain western
      city.  From a business standpoint, his trip came off badly.  Had he been successful
      in his enterprise, he would have  been set on his feet financially which, at
      the time, seemed vitally important.  But his venture wound up in a law suit
      and bogged down completely.  The proceeding was shot through with much hard
      feeling and controversy.\r\n    Bitterly discouraged, he found himself in a
      strange place, discredited and almost broke.  Still physically weak, and sober
      but a few months, he saw that his predicament was dangerous.  He wanted so much
      to talk with someone, but whom?\r\n    One dismal afternoon he paced a hotel
      lobby wondering how his bill was to be paid.  At one end of the room stood a
      glass covered directory of local churches.  Down the lobby a door opened into
      an attractive bar.  He could see the gay crowd inside.  In there he would find
      companionship and release.  Unless he took some drinks, he might not have the
      courage to scrape an acquaintance and would have a lonely week-end.\r\n    Of
      course he couldn't drink, but why not sit hopefully at a table, a bottle of
      ginger ale before him?  After all, had he not been sober six months now?  Perhaps
      he could handle, say, three drinks-no more!  Fear gripped him.  He was on thin
      ice.  Again it was the old, insidious insanity-that first drink.  With a shiver,
      he turned away and walked down the lobby to the church directory.  Music and
      gay chatter still floated to him from the bar.\r\n    But what about his responsibilities-his
      family and the men who would die because they would not know how to get well,
      ah-yes, those other alcoholics?  There must be many such in this town.  He would
      phone a clergyman.  His sanity returned and he thanked God.  Selecting a church
      at random from the directory, he stepped into a booth and lifted the receiver.\r\n
      \   His call to the clergyman led him presently to a certain resident of the
      town, who, though formerly able and respected, was then nearing the nadir of
      alcoholic despair.  It was the usual situation: home in jeopardy, wife ill,
      children distracted, bills in arrears and standing damaged.  He had a desperate
      desire to stop, but saw no way out, for he had earnestly tried many avenues
      of escape.  Painfully aware of being somehow abnormal, the man did not fully
      realize what it meant to be alcoholic.\r\n    When our friend related his experience,
      the man agreed that no amount of will power he might muster could stop his drinking
      for long.  A spiritual experience, he conceded, was absolutely necessary, but
      the price seemed high upon the basis suggested.  He told how he lived in constant
      worry about those who might find out about his alcoholism.  He had, of course,
      the familiar alcoholic obsession that few knew of his drinking.  Why, he argued,
      should he lose the remainder of his business, only to bring still more suffering
      to his family by foolishly admitting his plight to people from whom he made
      his livelihood?  He would do anything, he said, but that.\r\n    Being intrigued,
      however, he invited our friend to his home.  Some time later, and just as he
      thought  he was getting control of his liquor situation, he went on a roaring
      bender.  For him, this was the spree that ended all sprees.  He saw that he
      would have to face\r\n    \r\n    his problems squarely that God might give
      him mastery.\r\n    One morning he took the bull by the horns and set out to
      tell those he feared what his trouble had been.  He found himself surprisingly
      well received, and learned that many knew of his drinking.  Stepping into his
      car, he made the rounds of people he had hurt.  He trembled as he went about,
      for this might mean ruin, particularly to a person in his line of business.\r\n
      \   At midnight he came home exhausted, but very happy.  He has not had a drink
      since.  As we shall see, he now means a great deal to his community, and the
      major liabilities of thirty years of hard drinking have been repaired in four.\r\n
      \   But life was not easy for the two friends.  Plenty of difficulties presented
      themselves.  Both saw that they must keep spiritually active.  One day they
      called up the head nurse of a local hospital.  They explained their need and
      inquired if she had a first class alcoholic prospect.\r\n    She replied, 'Yes,
      we've got a corker.  He's just beaten up a couple of nurses.  Goes off his head
      completely when he's drinking.  But he's a grand chap when he's sober, though
      he's been in here eight times in the last six months.  Understand he was once
      a well-known lawyer in town, but just now we've got him strapped down tight.'
      \r\n    Here was a prospect all right but, by the description, none too promising.
      \ The use of spiritual principles in such cases was not so well understood as
      it is now.  But one of the friends said, 'Put him in a private room.  We'll
      be down.'\r\n    Two days later, a future fellow of Alcoholics Anonymous stared
      glassily at the strangers beside his bed.  'Who are you fellows, and why this
      private room?  I was always in a ward before.'\r\n    Said one of the visitors,
      'We're giving you a treatment for alcoholism.'\r\n    Hopelessness was written
      large on the man's face as he replied, 'Oh, but that's no use.  Nothing would
      fix me.  I'm a goner.  The last three times, I got drunk on the way home from
      here.  I'm afraid to go out the door.  I can't understand it.'\r\n    For an
      hour, the two friends told him about their drinking experiences.  Over and over,
      he would say: 'That's me.  That's me.  I drink like that.'\r\n    The man in
      the bed was told of the acute poisoning from which he suffered, how it deteriorates
      the body of an alcoholic and warps his mind.  There was much talk about the
      mental state preceding the first drink.\r\n    'Yes, that's me,' said the sick
      man, 'the very image.  You fellows know your stuff all right, but I don't see
      what good it'll do.  You fellows are somebody.  I was once, but I'm a nobody
      now.  From what you tell me, I know more than ever I can't stop.'  At this both
      the visitors burst into a laugh.  Said the future Fellow Anonymous: 'Damn little
      to laugh about that I can see.'\r\n    The two friends spoke of their spiritual
      experience and told him about the course of action they carried out.\r\n    He
      interrupted: 'I used to be strong for the church, but that won't fix it.  I've
      prayed to God on hangover mornings and sworn that I'd never touch another drop
      but by nine o'clock I'd be boiled as an owl.'\r\n    Next day found the prospect
      more receptive.  He had been thinking it over.  'Maybe you're right,' he said.
      \ 'God ought to be able to do anything.'  Then he added, 'He sure didn't do
      much for me when I was trying to fight this booze racket alone.'\r\n    On the
      third day the lawyer gave his life to the care and direction of his Creator,
      and said he was perfectly willing to do anything necessary.  His wife came,
      scarcely daring to be hopeful, though she thought she saw something different
      about her husband already.  He had begun to have a spiritual experience.\r\n
      \   That afternoon he put on his clothes and walked from the hospital a free
      man.  He entered a political campaign, making speeches, frequenting men's gathering
      places of all sorts, often staying up all night.  He lost the race by only a
      narrow margin.  But he had found God-and in finding God had found himself.\r\n
      \   That was in June, 1935.  He never drank again.  He too, has become a respected
      and useful member of his community.  He has helped other men recover, and is
      a power in the church from which he was long absent.\r\n    So, you see, there
      were three alcoholics in that town, who now felt they had to give to others
      what they had found, or be sunk.  After several failures to find others, a fourth
      turned up.  He came through an acquaintance who had heard the good news.  He
      proved to be a devil-may-care young fellow whose parents could not make out
      whether he wanted to stop drinking or not.  They were deeply religious people,
      much shocked by their son's refusal to have anything to do with the church.
      \ He suffered horribly from his sprees, but it seemed as if nothing could be
      done for him.  He consented, however, to go to the hospital, where he occupied
      the very room recently vacated by the lawyer.\r\n    He had three visitors.
      \ After a bit, he said, 'The way you fellows put this spiritual stuff makes
      sense.  I'm ready to do business.  I guess the old folks were right after all.'
      \ So one more was added to the Fellowship.\r\n    All this time our friend of
      the hotel lobby incident remained in that town.  He was there three months.
      \ He now returned home, leaving behind his first acquaintance, the lawyer and
      the devil-may-care chap.  These men had found something brand new in life.  Though
      they knew they must help other alcoholics if they would remain sober, that motive
      became secondary.  It was transcended by the happiness they found in giving
      \ themselves for others.  They shared their homes, their slender resources,
      and gladly devoted their spare hours to fellow-sufferers.  They were willing,
      by day or night, to place a new man in the hospital and visit him afterward.
      \ They grew in numbers.  They experienced a few distressing failures, but in
      those cases they made an effort to bring the man's family into a spiritual way
      of living, thus relieving much worry and suffering.\r\n    A year and six months
      later these three had succeeded with seven more.  Seeing much of each other,
      scarce an evening passed that someone's home did not shelter a little gathering
      of men and women, happy in their release, and constantly thinking how they might
      present their discovery to some newcomer.  In addition to these casual get-togethers,
      it became customary to set apart one night a week for a meeting to be attended
      by anyone or everyone interested in a spiritual way of life.  Aside from fellowship
      and sociability, the prime object was to provide a time and place where new
      people might bring their problems.\r\n    Outsiders became interested.  One
      man and his wife placed their large home at the disposal of this strangely assorted
      crowd.  This couple has since become so fascinated that they have dedicated
      their home to the work.  Many a distracted wife has visited this house to find
      loving and understanding companionship among women who knew her problem, to
      hear from the lips of their husbands what had happened to them, to be advised
      how her own wayward mate might be hospitalized and approached when next he stumbled.\r\n
      \   Many a man, yet dazed from his hospital experience, has stepped over the
      threshold of that home into freedom.  Many an alcoholic who entered there came
      away with an answer.  He succumbed to that gay crowd inside, who laughed at
      their own misfortunes and understood his.  Impressed by those who visited him
      at the hospital, he capitulated entirely when, later, in an upper room of this
      house, he heard the story of some man whose experience closely tallied with
      his own.  The expression on the faces of the women, that indefinable something
      in the eyes of the men, the stimulating and electric atmosphere of the place,
      conspired to let him know that here was haven at last.\r\n    The very practical
      approach to his problems, the absence of intolerance of any kind, the informality,
      the genuine democracy, the uncanny understanding which these people had were
      irresistible.  He and his wife would leave elated by the thought of what they
      could now do for some stricken acquaintance and his family.  They knew they
      had a host of new friends; it seemed they had known these strangers always.
      \ They had seen miracles, and one was to come to them.  They had visioned the
      Great Reality-their loving and All Powerful Creator.\r\n    Now, this house
      will hardly accommodate its weekly visitors, for they number sixty or eighty
      as a rule.  Alcoholics are being attracted from far and near.  From surrounding
      towns, families drive long distances to be present.  A community thirty miles
      away has fifteen fellows of Alcoholics Anonymous.  Being a large place, we think
      that some day its Fellowship will number many hundreds.\r\n    But life among
      Alcoholics Anonymous is more than attending gatherings and visiting hospitals.
      \ Cleaning up old scrapes, helping to settle family differences, explaining
      the disinherited son to his irate parents, lending money and securing jobs for
      each other, when justified-these are everyday occurrences.  No one is too discredited
      or has sunk too low to be welcomed cordially-if he means business.  Social distinctions,
      petty rivalries and jealousies-these are laughed out of countenance.  Being
      wrecked in the same vessel, being restored and united under one God, with hearts
      and minds attuned to the welfare of others, the things which matter so much
      to some people no longer signify much to them.  How could they?\r\n    Under
      only slightly different conditions, the same thing is taking place in many eastern
      cities.  In one of these there is a well-known hospital for the treatment of
      alcoholic and drug addiction.  Six years ago one of our number was a patient
      there.  Many of us have felt, for the first time, the Presence and Power of
      God within its walls.  We are greatly indebted to the doctor in attendance there,
      for he, although it might prejudice his own work, has told us of his belief
      in ours.\r\n    Every few days this doctor suggests our approach to one of his
      patients.  Understanding our work, he can do this with an eye to selecting those
      who are willing and able to recover on a spiritual basis.  Many of us, former
      patients, go there to help.  Then, in this eastern city, there are informal
      meetings such as we have described to you, where you may now see scores of members.
      \ There are the same fast friendships, there is the same helpfulness to one
      another as you find among our western friends.  There is a good bit of travel
      between East and West and we foresee a great increase in this helpful interchange.\r\n
      \   Some day we hope that every alcoholic who journeys will find a Fellowship
      of Alcoholics Anonymous at his destination.  To some extent this is already
      true.  Some of us are salesmen and go about.  Little clusters of twos and threes
      and fives of us have sprung up in other communities, through contact with our
      two larger centers.  Those of us who travel drop in as often as we can.  This
      practice enables us to lend a hand, at the same time avoiding certain alluring
      distractions of the road, about which any traveling man can inform you.\r\n
      \   Thus we grow.  And so can you, though you be but one man with this book
      in your hand.  We believe and hope it contains all you will need to begin.\r\n
      \   We know what you are thinking.  You are saying to yourself: 'I'm jittery
      and alone.  I couldn't do that.'  But you can.  You forget that you have just
      now tapped a source of power much greater than yourself.  To duplicate, with
      such backing, what we have accomplished is only a matter of willingness, patience
      and labor.\r\n    We know of an A.A. member who was living in a large community.
      \ He had lived there but a few weeks when he found that the place probably contained
      more alcoholics per square mile than any city in the country.  This was only
      a few days ago at this writing.  (1939)  The authorities were much concerned.
      \ He got in touch with a prominent psychiatrist who had undertaken certain responsibilities
      for the mental health of the community.  The doctor proved to be able and exceedingly
      anxious to adopt any workable method of handling the situation.  So he inquired,
      what did our friend have on the ball?\r\n    Our friend proceeded to tell him.
      \ And with such good effect that the doctor agreed to a test among his patients
      and certain other alcoholics from a clinic which he attends.  Arrangements were
      also made with the chief psychiatrist of a large public hospital to select still
      others from the stream of misery which flows through that institution.\r\n    So
      our fellow worker will soon have friends galore.  Some of them may sink and
      perhaps never get up, but if our experience is a criterion, more than half of
      those approached will become fellows of Alcoholics Anonymous.  When a few men
      in this city have found themselves, and have discovered the joy of helping others
      to face life again, there will be no stopping until everyone in that town has
      had his opportunity to recover-if he can and will.\r\n    Still you may say:
      'But I will not have the benefit of contact with you who write this book.'  We
      cannot be sure.  God will determine that, so you must remember that your real
      reliance is always upon Him.  He will show you how to create the fellowship
      you crave.\r\n    Our book is meant to be suggestive only.  We realize we know
      only a little.  God will constantly disclose more to you and to us.  Ask Him
      in your morning meditation what you can do each day for the man who is still
      sick.  The answers will come, if your own house is in order.  But obviously
      you cannot transmit something you haven't got.  See to it that your relationship
      with Him is right, and great events will come to pass for you and countless
      others.  This is the Great Fact for us.\r\n    Abandon yourself to God as you
      understand God.  Admit your faults to Him and to your fellows.  Clear away the
      wreckage of your past.  Give freely of what you find and join us.  We shall
      be with you in the Fellowship of the Spirit, and you will surely meet some of
      us as you trudge the Road of Happy Destiny.\r\n    May God bless you and keep
      you-until then."

    - LA HISTORIA DE BILL
    - |
      La fiebre de la guerra estaba en su apogeo en aquel pueblo de Nueva Inglaterra al cual habíamos sido asignados nosotros, los jóvenes oficiales procedentes de la ciudad de Plattsburg, y nos sentíamos elogiados cuando los primeros vecinos en recibirnos nos llevaban a sus casas y nos hacían sentir héroes. Estaban aquí, pues, el amor, el triunfo , la guerra; momentos sublimes salpicados de los intervalos más dichosos. Era yo, finalmente, parte de la vida y en medio de la alegría, descubrí el licor. Me olvidé de las enérgicas advertencias y de los prejuicios de mi familia en lo que se refería a beber. Llegado el momento zarpamos hacia ultramar. Me sentí muy solo y de nuevo acudí al alcohol.
      Desembarcamos en Inglaterra y visité la Catedral de Winchester. Muy conmovido me salí a caminar. Mi atención fue atraída por una leyenda grabada en la lápida de una tumba:
      Aquí yace un granadero de Hampshire Quien pasó a la otra vida       Porque bebía bastante cerveza       Un viejo soldado nunca es olvidado Haya muerto por mosquete
      O por el tarro.       Ahí estaba una severa advertencia que yo no supe tomar en cuenta. Una vez que regresé al país, a los veintidós años, era ya un
      veterano de guerra en el extranjero. Fantaseaba yo con mis cualidades de jefe: los hombres de mi batallón ¿acaso no me habían ya dado un testimonio de su particular aprecio por mí? Mi talento para ser líder me iba a colocar a la cabeza de enormes empresas que dirigiría yo con la más grande de las seguridades.
      Asistí a un curso nocturno de derecho y, posteriormente, obtuve un empleo como investigador en una compañía aseguradora. La carrera hacia el éxito ya había comenzado. Iba a demostrar al mundo entero que yo era alguien. Mi trabajo me llevó a Wall Street y, poco a poco, me fui interesando en el mercado de valores. Había muchos que perdían dinero, pero otros hacían fortunas. ¿Por qué yo no?
      ￼
      Estudiaba economía y ciencias de la administración, además de derecho. Por mi propensión al alcohol casi reprobé mi curso de derecho. Me presenté a uno de los exámenes finales, tan borracho para escribir como para pensar. Aunque en esta época no bebía yo de manera continua, mi esposa ya se mostraba muy inquieta. Teníamos largas conversaciones durante las cuales intentaba yo tranquilizar sus presagios diciéndole que los hombres geniales habían tenido sus mejores ideas bajo el efecto del alcohol; que las más sublimes teorías filosóficas habían nacido de la misma manera.
      Cuando finalizó mi curso de derecho, yo sabía ya que no estaba hecho para esta disciplina. Estaba envuelto por el torbellino de Wall Street. Los amos de las finanzas y del mundo de los negocios eran mis héroes. Mezclando el alcohol con la especulación financiera, empecé a forjar el bumerán que un día se volvería en mi contra y me haría pedazos. Como vivíamos en forma modesta, mi mujer y yo habíamos economizado 1 000 dólares. Este dinero nos sirvió para comprar unas acciones de muy poca demanda y que tenían un buen precio. Tenía yo razón a pensar que algún día estas acciones llegarían a tener mucho valor. No había yo podido convencer a mis amigos de la Bolsa para que me enviaran a investigar acerca de la administración de fábricas y de otras empresas; sin embargo, mi esposa y yo decidimos ir de cualquier forma. Estaba yo plenamente convencido de que la gente perdía dinero en la Bolsa debido a su ignorancia sobre los mercados. Más tarde, yo encontraría muchas razones más.
      Dejamos nuestros empleos para ir a la aventura a bordo de una motocicleta en cuyo remolque colocamos una tienda de campaña, cobijas, ropa para cambiarnos y tres voluminosos anuarios sobre referencias bursátiles. Nuestros amigos nos decían que estábamos locos de atar y quizá sí tenían razón. Gracias a algunas especulaciones de suerte, teníamos un poco de dinero de sobra; sin embargo, una vez tuvimos que trabajar en una granja durante un mes, para evitar gastarnos ese pequeño capital. Por mucho tiempo, yo no tendría otro trabajo manual honesto como éste. En un año ya habíamos recorrido toda la parte oriental de los Estados Unidos. Los informes que había yo enviado a Wall Street durante este tiempo me significaron a mi regreso una posición destacada, así como la posibilidad de disponer de una generosa cuenta de gastos. Otra „transacción“ afortunada en ese año me proporcionó fondos adicionales que se tradujeron en una utilidad de varios miles de dólares.
      En el curso de los años siguientes, la suerte me trajo dinero y triunfos. Ya había yo „llegado“. Numerosos eran aquéllos que adoptaban mis ideas y se fiaban de mi juicio en esta danza de millones de dólares. La gran ola de prosperidad del final de la década de los veintes estaba en su cúspide. El tomar una copa se había convertido en una cosa importante para mí. En los salones donde se tocaba jazz, el parloteo era altísimo. Todos gastaban miles de dólares y se hablaba en términos de millones. De los demás, yo me burlaba. Yo me había hecho de una multitud de amigos de los buenos tiempos.
      Mi consumo de alcohol aumentó seriamente. Bebía con- stantemente durante el día y casi todas las noches. Los reproches de mis amigos generaron disputas y me encontré solo de nuevo. Hubo numerosas escenas desdichadas en nuestro suntuoso apartamento. Jamás le había sido yo infiel a mi mujer debido a mi lealtad hacia ella, lealtad a menudo respaldada por mi estado extremo de embriaguez que me mantuvo alejado de estas andanzas.
      En 1929 se apoderó de mí la fiebre del golf. Me fui enseguida al campo con mi mujer para que aplaudiera, mientras que yo trataba de superar las hazañas de Walter Hagen. El alcohol me atrapó mucho más rápido de lo que hubiese yo podido vencer a Walter Hagen. Comencé a tener temblores por las mañanas. El golf era una oportunidad para beber todos los días y todas las noches. Experimentaba un gran placer en pasear a bordo del coche por los campos del selecto club que tanto me había impresionado cuando era joven. Ya usaba el magnífico abrigo que usaban los afortunados. El banquero de mi localidad me observaba depositar cheques de gran denominación con un divertido escepticismo. Entonces, en octubre de 1929 se desencadenó un infierno en la Bolsa de Valores de Nueva York. Después de uno de esos infernales días, iba yo titubeante del bar de un hotel a las oficinas de la correduría. Eran las ocho de la noche, cinco horas después de haber cerrado el mercado.
      El telégrafo aún estaba funcionando. Me quedé observando un pedazo de papel sobre el cual aparecía la inscripción XYZ- 32. En la mañana se había cotizado en 52. Estaba yo arruinado al igual que
      ￼
      varios de mis amigos. Los diarios informaban acerca de personas que se habían suicidado lanzándose de lo alto de las torres de la Bolsa. Esa situación me provocó un disgusto. Pero yo no iba lanzarme. Me regresé al bar. Mis amigos habían perdido muchos millones desde las diez de la mañana, así pues ¿qué había de malo? Ya mañana sería otro día. A medida que estaba bebiendo, mi antigua y tenaz determinación por ganar regresó a mí.
      Al otro día por la mañana le llamé a un amigo en Montreal. A él le había quedado mucho dinero y era de la opinión de que mejor debía irme al Canadá. En la primavera siguiente, mi mujer y yo ya llevábamos de nuevo nuestro tren de vida habitual. Me sentía tal como Napoleón a su regreso de la Isla de Elba. ¡Nada de una Isla de Santa Helena para mi, eh! Pero la bebida me atrapó de nuevo y mi generoso amigo tuvo que dejarme ir. Esta vez nos íbamos a quedar sin dinero.
      Nos fuimos a vivir a la casa de mis suegros. Encontré un empleo y lo perdí como resultado de una pelea con un taxista. Miseri- cordiosamente, no hubo nadie que pudiese adivinar que yo iba a estar sin trabajo durante cinco años, o que iba a permanecer casi siempre ebrio durante todo ese lapso. Mi esposa empezó a trabajar en una tienda de departamentos. Llegaba a casa muy cansada sólo para verme borracho. En las firmas de correduría me convertí en un parásito indeseable.
      El licor dejó de ser un artíclo de lujo para convertirse en una necesidad. Dos o a veces tres botellas de ginebra de contrabando al día llegaron a ser mi ración habitual. De tiempo en tiempo, alguna transacción pequeña me dejaba algunos cientos de dólares; era entonces cuando iba a pagar a los bares y las tiendas de abarrotes. El mismo ciclo se repetía sin cesar. Posteriormente, empecé a despertar muy temprano en la madrugada sacudiéndome con violentos temblores. Tenía que beber cuando menos un vaso grande de ginebra y seis botellas de cerveza para poder estar en condiciones de desayunar. Pero, con todo esto, yo estaba convencido de poder controlar la situación y atravesaba por períodos de sobriedad que le devolvían la esperanza a mi esposa.
      Las cosas empezaron a deteriorarse poco a poco. La casa fue
      ￼
      embargada por el poseedor de la hipoteca, murió mi suegra y mi mujer y mi suegro enfermaron.
      Fue entonces que un prometedor negocio se me presentó. Las acciones estaban en su nivel más bajo en el año de 1932, y de alguna manera yo tenía a un grupo de compradores. Se me iba a dejar una parte generosa de las utilidades. Pero entonces una tremenda borrachera me hizo perder esa oportunidad.
      Este golpe me abrió los ojos. Tenía que parar. Me di cuenta de que no podía beber ni una sola copa. Estaba yo liquidado para siempre. Hasta esa fecha había yo hecho una gran cantidad de bellas promesas; sin embargo, mi esposa pensó que esa vez sí hablaba yo en serio. Y efectivamente, hablaba yo en serio.
      Un poco después regresé ebrio a casa. No había podido resistir. ¿Qué había pasado con mis grandes resoluciones? No tenía yo la más mínima idea. No habían llegado a mi mente. Alguien, alguien me había ofrecido un trago y yo lo bebí. ¿Es que estaba yo loco? Empecé a preguntármelo, pues tan asombrosa inconsistencia parecía confirmarlo.
      Con una renovada resolución intenté de nuevo. Después de un cierto tiempo, la confianza que había yo adquirido comenzó a cederle su lugar a la presunción. ¡Ya podía darle la espalda aas cantinas y al alcohol. Ya tenía de ahora en adelante lo que me hacía falta! Un día entré a un bar para hacer una llamada. En un corto tiempo estaba yo golpeteando sobre la barra y preguntándome cómo había ocurrido. Cuando el whisky se me fue a la cabeza me dije que para la siguiente ocasión controlaría mejor las cosas, pero por lo que hacía a ese momento lo mejor era emborracharse. Y así lo hice.
      Jamás podré olvidar el remordimiento, el terror y la desesperación que volví a sentir en las primeras horas de la mañana. No tenía el coraje para combatir. No alcanzaba a controlar mi agitada cabeza y tenía el sentimiento de una inminente catástrofe. Con trabajos me atreví a cruzar la calle para no caerme y ser arrollado por un camión. Apenas había un poco de luz de día. Un lugar que funcionaba toda la noche me surtió con una docena de vasos de cerveza. Finalmente, mis crispados nervios se calmaron. Al leer el diario de la mañana me enteré de que el
      ￼
      mercado de valores nuevamente se había ido a pique. Lo mismo que yo. El mercado de valores se iba a recuperar, pero yo no. Esta última idea me dañó mucho. ¿Suicidarme? No. Ahora no. Una neblina mental se asentó. Ya la ginebra se encargaría de eso. Dos botellas más y... el olvido.
      El cuerpo y la mente son unas máquinas prodigiosas, pues los míos resistieron esta agonía por dos años más. A veces, cuando el terror y la locura de la mañana se apoderaban de mí, robaba algo de dinero del pobre portamonedas de mi esposa. De nuevo, tambaleándome y vacilando ante una ventana abierta, o ante el botiquín de medicinas donde había veneno, maldiciéndome por ser un cobarde. Mi esposa y yo, buscando huir de esta situación, salíamos de viaje al campo y de regreso a la ciudad. Llegó entonces la noche en que la tortura física y mental era tan infernal que temí suicidarme lanzándome a través de la ventana, haciéndola añicos. De alguna manera pude arrastrar mi colchón a un piso inferior, para el caso de que saltara por la ventana. Un médico vino a administrarme sedantes poderosos. Al día siguiente ya estaba yo mezclando licor con los calmantes. Esta combinación en breve tiempo me llevó al punto de crisis. Las personas temían por mi salud mental. Y también yo. Cuando bebía, no comía nada, o casi nada. Me faltaban cuarenta libras para llegar a mi peso normal.
      Gracias a la bondad de mi madre y de mi cuñado médico, fui admitido en un hospital reconocido en todo el país por su programa de rehabilitación física y mental para alcohólicos. Bajo los efectos de un tratamiento con belladona, se aclaró mi mente. La hidroterapia y los ejercicios ligeros me hicieron bien. Pero lo mejor de todo fue que me topé con un médico comprensivo. Me explicó que aunque indudablemente egoísta y estúpido, yo había estado seriamente enfermo tanto del cuerpo como mentalmente.
      Me consoló un poco el saber que, para los alcohólicos, la voluntad es asombrosamente débil cuando se trata de combatir el alcohol, sin importar lo fuerte que pueda ser para otros asuntos. Encontraba yo al fin una explicación a mi comportamiento increíblemente en desacuerdo con mi intenso deseo de dejar de beber. Comprendiendo al fin mi condición, me fui lleno de esperanzas. Durante tres o cuatro
      ￼
      meses, el optimismo me daba alas. Iba yo a la ciudad en forma regular y hasta gané algo de dinero. El conocimiento de uno mismo: era ahí donde seguramente estaba la respuesta.
      Ésta no era la respuesta, pues llegó el terrible día en que bebí de nuevo. Mi salud moral y física se fue al precipicio. Después de cierto tiempo regresé de nuevo al hospital.
      Tuve la impresión de que era el fin, la caída del telón. Mi pobre esposa, extenuada y desesperada, fue advertida acerca de mi estado. Moriría yo de una falla cardiaca durante una crisis de delirium tremens o, bien, me afectaría un caso de impregnación etílica del cerebro, quizás en el curso de un año. En breve fecha ella estaría decidiendo si me confiaba al cuidado de las pompas fúnebres o a un hospital psiquiátrico.
      No fue necesario que me lo dijeran. Yo lo sabía y estaba casi feliz. Era un golpe mortal asestado a mi orgullo. Héme ahí, yo, que tenía una opinión tan alta de mí mismo, de mis aptitudes y de mi capacidad para salvar obstáculos, estaba totalmente derrotado. Iba ahora a hundirme en la oscuridad, uniéndome a la interminable fila de ebrios que me habían precedido. Pensé en mi desdichada esposa. Sí, había existido mucha felicidad, después de todo. Qué no haría yo por restablecer nuestra dañada relación matrimonial. Pero en este punto ya era demasiado tarde.
      No tengo palabras para describir la soledad y la desesperación que viví en esa amarga negrura de la conmiseración de mí mismo. Tenía la sensación de estar rodeado de arenas movedizas. Eran más fuertes que yo; estaba vencido; el alcohol era mi dueño.
      Cuando, todo tembloroso, salí del hospital, era un hombre derrotado. El miedo me hizo dejar de beber temporalmente. Un poco después, en la celebración del Armisticio de 1934, la isidiosa aberración de esa primera copa se volvió a apoderar de mí, y una vez más volví a empezar. Ya todos se habían hecho a la idea y aceptaban la certera eventualidad de mi internamiento o de mi final desdichado. ¡Qué oscuro es todo antes de la aurora! De hecho, estaba viviendo el principio de mi debacle final. Yo estaba seguro del hecho de ser lanzado hacia aquello que me gustaba llamar la cuarta dimensión de la existencia. Iba a descubrir la dicha, la paz y una razón de ser, gracias a un modo de vida que se revela increíblemente más maravilloso, día con día.
      Una de esas tristes tardes de finales del mes de noviembre, tomé un vaso y me senté en la cocina. Estaba bastante contento de pensar que había suficiente ginebra escondida en la casa para poder pasar la noche y el día siguiente. Mi esposa estaba trabajando. Yo me preguntaba si sería capaz de atreverme a esconder una botella cerca de la cabecera de nuestra cama. La iba a necesitar antes de que amaneciera.
      Mis sueños fueron interrumpdos por el teléfono. Con una voz llena de buen amor, un antiguo compañero de escuela me preguntaba si podría pasar a visitarme. Estaba sin beber. No recordaba que él hubiese venido a Nueva York en ese estado desde hacía años.
      Yo estaba asombrado. Corría el rumor de que había sido internado en un hospital por locura alcohólica. No podía dejar de preguntarme cómo había hecho para escaparse. Bueno, de seguro, cenaría en casa y entonces podría yo beber en su compañía sin tener que esconderme. Muy poco cuidadoso de su bienestar, yo sólo pensaba en recapturar el espíritu de otros días. Alguna vez fletamos un avión ¡para completar una juerga! Su llegada iba a ser un oasis en este temible desierto en el que nada parecía funcionar. Sí, así era – ¡un oasis! Así son los alcohólicos.
      Cuando le abrí la puerta, le vi la piel fresca y el semblante brillante. Había algo de particular en su mirada. Era diferente, pero sin que pueda yo explicar por qué. ¿Qué le habría ocurrido?
      Le extendí un vaso a través de la mesa. Lo rechazó. Desilusionado, pero con mucha curiosidad me preguntaba yo qué le había ocurrido. Ya no era el mismo.
      — Vamos, vamos. ¿Qué pasa? — pregunté.
      Me miró derecho a los ojos. Y, en forma sencilla pero sonriente, me dijo:
      — Ya tengo religión.
      Me quedé petrificado. Conque eso era: El año anterior un alcohólico enloquecido; ahora, sospechaba yo, algo intoxicado de religión. Tenía esa mirada de ojos encendidos. Sí, el compañerito estaba de nuevo emocionado con algo. ¡Bueno, pues que Dios lo bendiga y que se ponga a predicar! Además, mi ginebra iba a durar más que su sermoneo.
      Pero no predicó. En poco tiempo me platicó cómo dos hombres se habían presentado ante un tribunal y habían convencido al juez para que no lo enviara a prisión. Ellos habían comentado acerca de una idea religiosa simple y de un programa de acción para poner en práctica. Eso había ocurrido dos meses atrás y el resultado era elocuente: ¡funcionaba!
      Él había llegado para beneiciarme con su experiencia, si es que yo lo deseaba. Estaba aturdido, pero sí me interesé. ¡Claro que me interesaba! Y no podía ser de otra manera, ya que no tenía remedio.
      Habló durante horas. Los recuerdos de mi infancia llegaban a mi mente. Me parecía escuchar, como en aquellos domingos apacibles, la voz del predicador que me llegaba de lejos hasta la colina donde yo estaba sentado; estaba ahí el juramento de no beber vinos ni otros licores que nunca firmé; el desprecio moderado de mi abuelo hacia algunos adoradores y sus actos; su insistencia en que las esferas celestiales tenían música; mas su negativa al derecho del predicador de decirle a él cómo debía escuchar tal música y cómo hablaba sin temor alguno de sus convicciones justamente antes de morir; todos esos recuerdos afloraron a la superficie. Tenía yo la garganta reseca.
      Volví a pensar en ese día de la guerra en que visité la Catedral de Winchester.
      Siempre había creído en un poder superior a mí mismo. Siempre había reflexioo sobre estas cosas. No era ateo. Pocas gentes lo son realmente, pues el ateísmo implica una fe ciega en la hipótesis extraña de que este universo ha salido de la nada y va hacia la nada. Mis héroes intelectuales, los químicos, los astrónomos, aun los evolucionistas suponían que grandes leyes y grandes fuerzas regían este mundo. A pesar de pruebas contrarias, me quedaban pocas dudas de que un motivo y un orden poderosos regían ese mundo. ¿Cómo podrían existir tantas leyes precisas e inmutables sin que hubiese la intervención de alguna forma de inteligencia? No podía hacer otra cosa que creer en un Espíritu del universo, el cual no conocía ni tiempos, ni límites. Pero era hasta ahí adonde yo había llegado.
      Es así que me alejé de los ministros religiosos y del mundo de la
      ￼
      religión. En cuanto se me hablaba de un Dios personal, de un Dios que era amor, dirección y fuerza suprahumanos, me irritaba y mi mente se cerraba de golpe contra tal teoría.
      A Cristo le concedía yo el valor de serun gran hombre, cuyos discípulos no lo habían seguido fielmente. Sus enseñanzas morales, excelentes. Por mi parte, me había quedado con los principios que me parecían prácticos y que no eran demasiado exigentes; y el resto lo deseché.
      Las guerras que se habían peleado, los incendios y las trampas que la controversia religiosa había provocado me enfermaban. Me preguntaba sinceramente si, en su totalidad, las religiones del mundo tendrían algo de bueno. Eso era por lo que yo había visto en Europa y después, el poder de Dios en los actos humanos era insignificante, la Fraternidad entre los Hombres era una farsa trágica. Si existía el diablo, él parecía ser el dueño del mundo y de los destinos humanos y, cosa cierta, era mi dueño.
      Pero mi amigo, sentado frente a mí, declaró a quemarropa que Dios había hecho por él lo que él nunca pudo hacer para sí. Su voluntad de ser humano había fracasado. La medicina lo había declarado como irrecuperable. La sociedad se estaba apresurando a encerrarloAsí como yo, él había admitido su derrota total. Más tarde, literalmente, había resucitado de entre los muertos, repentinamente sacado del fondo más bajo hacia un nivel de vida mejor que él hubiese jamás conocido.
      ¿Habría surgido esta fuerza de él mismo? No, claro que no. No había habido en él más fuerza que la yo hubiese tenido en ese momento; y esto era nada, nada en absoluto.
      Me cayó aquello como una tonelada de ladrillos. Empecé a creer que las personas con religión habían tenido quizás la razón, después de todo. Había ocurrido algo en el corazón de un hombre y este algo había logrado lo imposible. Mi opinión acerca de los milagros había sido de súbito reexaminada. Poco importaba el tiempo lejano: tenía ante mí, al otro lado de la mesa, a un milagro viviente. Él aportaba un suceso extraordinario.
      Vi que mi amigo estaba mucho más que readaptado psicológica- mente. Sus raíces habían llegado hasta un suelo nuevo.
      ￼
      A pesar de su ejemplo viviente, me quedaban aún vestigios de mis viejos prejuicios. La palabra Dios aún causaba en mí una cierta antipatía. Una vez que fue expresada la idea de que podría existir un Dios personal que se ocupase de mí, mi antipatía se intensificó. La idea no me agradaba. Podría aceptar ciertas concepciones tales como de una Inteligencia Creadora, de una Mente Universal o del Alma de la Naturaleza, pero me resistía al concepto de Emperador de los Cielos, no obstante lo amable que su dominio pudiese ser. Desde entonces he platicado con infinidad de personas que pensaban como yo.
      Mi amigo hizo una sugerencia que me pareció novedosa: „¿Por qué no seleccionas por ti mismo tu propia concepción de Dios?”
      Su proposición me golpeó el corazón. Sentí que se derretía la montaña glacial de los prejuicios intelectuales a la sombra de los cuales yo había temblado por años y años. Al fin, volvía yo a encontrar el sol.
      Se trataba solamente de estar dispuesto a creer en un Poder Superior a mí mismo. No tenía que hacer nada más para comenr. Vi que el crecimiento podría iniciar a partir de ese punto. Al adoptar una actitud de completa buena voluntad, podría yo conocer el cambio que veía en mi amigo. ¿Lo lograría? ¡Claro que lo lograría!
      Es de esta manera que he llegado a convencerme de que Dios se ocupa de los hombres, cuando lo deseamos con todo el corazón. Al fin veía, sentía, creía. Capas y capas de orgullo y de prejuicio caían de mis ojos. Un nuevo mundo aparecía ante mi vista.
      Repentinamente comprendí el verdadero significado de la experiencia de la catedral. Por un instante yo había tenido necesidad de Dios y Lo había querido. Tímidamente yo había querido que estuviese allí y Él había venido. Pero muy pronto el sentimiento de su presencia había sido sofocado por los clamores del mundo, sobre todo aquéllos que se elevaban dentro de mí. Y así había sido desde entonces. ¡Qué ciego había estado!
      En el hospital me separé del alcohol por última vez. El tratamiento parecía ser el indicado, ya que yo mostraba sínomas de delirium tremens.
      Después, yo me ofrecí humildemente a Dios, tal como lo concebí, Le pedí que dispusiese de mí como Él lo deseara. Me puse sin reservas
      ￼
      bajo Su cuidado y dirección. Admití por vez primera que por mí mismo yo no era nada; que sin Él estaba yo perdido. Sin reservas encaré mis pecados y estuve de acuerdo en que mi nuevo Amigo los extirpase. Desde entonces jamás he vuelto a beber.
      Mi antiguo compañero de escuela me vino a visitar y le hice saber todos mis problemas y todas mis deficiencias. Hicimos la lista de personas a quienes en alguna forma yo les hubiese causado un daño o hacia quienes yo nutría rencores. Me mostré enteramente dispuesto a encontrar a esas personas y a admitir mis errores, sin jamás juzgarlas. Yo iba a corregir todos mis errores lo mejor que pudiese.
      Debía poner a prueba mi pensamiento mediante la conciencia de la presencia de Dios en mí. El sentido común iba a ser sustituido por la guía divina. ¿Cómo? Cuando tuviese dudas, me sentaría tranqilamente y pediría solamente que me fuesen dadas la fuerza y la luz para atender mis problemas en la forma en que Dios lo quisiese. Jamás debería rezar para mí, sino para pedir ser más útil a los demás. Solamente así podría esperar ser correspondido. Pero, en tal caso, sería correspondido abundantemente.
      Mi amigo me prometió que cuando se realizaran estas cosas, viviría yo un nuevo género de relación con mi Creador; que tendría en mis manos los elementos de un modo de vida que traería la solución a todos mis problemas. Esencialmente, era suficiente creer en el poder de Dios y estar dispuesto, con toda humildad y con toda honestidad, a establecer y a mantener este nuevo orden de cosas.
      Simple, pero no sencillo; un precio habría de pagarse. Aquello significaba la destrucción de mi egocentrismo. Debía de poner todas las cosas en manos del Padre de la Luz que reina sobre todos nosotros.
      Estas proposiciones eran a la vez que radicales, revolucionarias; pero, a partir del momento en que las hubeceptado, el efecto fue electrizante. Tuve una impresión de victoria, seguida por una sensación de paz y serenidad como jamás la había experimentado. Tenía una confianza plena. Me sentí transportado, tal como si el tonificante viento fresco de las montañas me hubiese envuelto. A la mayoría de los seres humanos, Dios se le manifiesta poco a poco, pero Su encuentro conmigo fue repentino y profundo.
      ￼
      Durante un cierto tiempo me sentí inquieto; llamé a mi médico amigo para preguntarle si él creía que yo aun estuviese sano de la mente. Asombrado, escuchaba lo que yo le contaba.
      Finalmente, y sacudiendo su cabeza, me dijo: „ Algo ha llegado a ti que no alcanzo a comprender. Pero es preferible que te aferres a ello. No importa lo que sea, pero es mejor que el estado en que te encontrabas.” Al día de hoy, este buen doctor tiene a menudo la oportunidad de encontrar pacientes que desarrollan experiencias como la mía. Él sabe que son verdaderas.
      En mi cama del hospital me asaltaba el pensamiento deque habría miles de alcohólicos desesperados que estarían felices de beneficiarse con aquello que me había sido dado de manera tan gratuita. Quizás pudiese ir en auxilio de algunos. A su vez, ellos podrían acudir en auxilio de otros.
      Mi amigo había insistido sobre la absoluta necesidad de poner en práctica estos principios en todos los aspectos de mi vida. Era necesario, sobre todo, tratar de ayudar a otros alcohólicos tal como él lo había hecho conmigo. La fe sin obras es una fe muerta, me decía. ¡Qué importante es esto para los alcohólicos! Puesto que si un alcohólico se descuida en enriquecer y perfeccionar su vida espiritual con el trabajo y la dedicación hacia los demás, no podrá superar las pruebas y las depresiones que le esperan. Si no se empeña en este crecimiento interior, con toda seguridad volverá a beber y, si bebe, morirá, de seguro. Entonces, la fe estaría muerta, efectivamente. Y es así también para nosotros.
      Mi mujer y yo nos adherimos con entusiasmo a la idea de ayudr a otros alcohólicos a encontrar una solución a sus problemas. Ésta era una cosa óptima, ya que mis antiguos socios de negocios dudaron de mi restablecimiento durante un año y medio, periodo en el que tuve poco trabajo. No me sentí muy bien en ese tiempo y me atormentaban accesos de conmiseración por mí mismo y de resentimiento. Estos sentimientos algunas veces me hicieron casi volver a beber, sin embargo, comprendí que donde todos los demás métodos habían fracasado, la dedicación hacia otro alcohólico me mantenía a salvo. Más de una vez regresé a ese hospital, desesperado. Al hablarle a algún alcohólico ahí mismo, me levantaba y volvía a
      ￼
      andar sobre mis pies. Este modo de vida da resultados en los momentos difíciles.
      Rápidamente comenzamos a hacer amigos y, tras de nosotros surgió una Confraternidad, de la cual es maravilloso sentir uno que forma parte de ella. La alegría de vivir está siempre con nosotros, tanto en las situaciones de tensión, como en las de dificultades. He visto centenas de familias tomar el camino que en verdad los lleva a una meta; he visto desarrollarse favorablemente situaciones familiares en verdad desesperadas; he visto solucionarse enemistades y rencores; he visto hombres abandonar los manicomios y volver a sus puestos en las vidas de sus familias y de su ambiente social. Hombres de negocios y profesionistas han recuperado su rango social. No ha habido ningún género de dificultades o de miseria que no haya sido resuelto entre nosotros. En una ciudad del Oeste del país hay ochenta de nosotros con sus familias. Nos reunimos frecuentemente en nuestros diferentes hogares, a fin de que los recién llegados encuentren la amistad reconfortante que necesitan. En estas reuniones informales podemos encontrar de 40 a 80 personas. Estamos creciendo en número y en fuerza.
      Un alcohólico ebrio es un ser desagradable. La labor de persuasión que debemos desarrollar ante ellos es a veces ardua, cómica y trágica. Uno de nosotros, desafortunadamente, se suicidó en nestra casa. No pudo o no quiso comprender nuestro modo de vida.
      En aquello que hacemos hay una gran alegría. Supongo que algunas personas se escandalizarán a causa de lo que pareciese ser mundano y poco serio. Mas, bajo esa apariencia somos implacablemente serios. La fe en Dios debe de cumplir su obra día por día en nosotros y a través de nosotros, o si no perecemos.
      La mayoría de nosotros creen que ya no tenemos que buscar la Utopía. Lo que tenemos con nosotros, aquí, ahora, es eso. Todos los días, aquella sencilla conversación de mi amigo en la mesa de la cocina se repite y se multiplica en un círculo siempre más grande de paz sobre la tierra y de buena voluntad hacia los hombres.

    - HAY UNA SOLUCIÓN
    - |
      Quienes estamos en Alcohólicos Anónimos hemos conocido a más de cien personas de ambos sexos que se hallaban, en una cierta etapa de su existencia, tan desesperados como una vez lo estuvo Bill. Casi todos se restablecieron. Encontraron una solución a su problema de alcohol.
      Somos ciudadanos comunes. Todos los niveles de nuestro país y la mayor parte de las actividades y las profesiones están representados en nuestra agrupación, así como todos los grupos políticos, económicos, sociales y religiosos. Somos personas que por lo común no nos mezclamos. Mas en medio de nosotros existe una fraternidad, una aceptación y una bondad tan maravillosas que no podemos describirlas. Somos como aquellos pasajeros de un barco que, después de haber escapado del naufragio, se olvidan de las diferencias sociales y se unen en un mismo sentimiento de alegría y fraternidad, que va de popa a proa indistintamente. Mas, al contrario de lo que sucede con los pasajeros de una nave, la alegría de estar a salvo no se desvanece cuando alguno de nosotros vuelve a tomar su propio destino. El sentimiento de haber atravesado el mismo peligro es uno de los elementos del poderoso lazo que nos une. Sin embargo, por sí solo, este sentimiento no nos habría acercado unos a otros como ahora lo estamos.
      Lo que hay de extraordinario para cada uno de nosotros, es que hemos descubierto una solución común. Tenemos una salida sobre la cual estamos absolutamente de acuerdo y que nos une en una acción fraternal y armoniosa. Es este el gran mensaje que anuncia este libro a aquéllos que sufren de alcoholismo.
      Una enfermedad como el alcoholismo — hemos llegado a considerarlo como una enfermedad — afecta el entorno de aquél o de aquélla que lo sufre como ninguna otra enfermedad puede hacerlo. Un enfermo de cáncer cuenta con la simpatía de todos y nadie más se irrita o es lastimado. No sucede así con el alcoholismo, ya que esta enfermedad implica el aniquilamiento de todos las cosas de valor en la vida. El alcoholismo afecta a todos aquéllos que se relacionan con la persona afectada por el mismo. Fuente de terrible incomprensión y resentimiento, el alcoholismo es causa de inseguridad financiera, repulsa a los amigos y a los superiores. Las vidas inocentes de los hijos, de las esposas y de los padres de alguna forma se vuelven desdichadas por esta enfermedad. Y la lista de desgracias podría llevarse hasta lo infinito.
      Esperamos que nuestro libro informe y reconforte a aquéllos que pudiesen estar afectados por este mal. Ellos son muy numerosos.
      Psiquiatras de reconocida fama han tenido la oportunidad de tener como pacientes a algunos de nosotros y se han dado cuenta de que no han podido convencer a un alcohólico para que discuta su caso sin reservas. Y, cosa extraña, nuestras esposas, nuestros padres y nuestros amigos íntimos generalmente encuentran difícil establecer contacto con un alcohólico.
      Como contrapartida, sin embargo, el antiguo bebedor que ha encontrado nuestra solución y que conoce bien los hechos en lo que concierne a su alcoholismo, generalmente puede llegar a ser el confidente de otro alcohólico en pocas horas. Pero, en tanto que no exista esta comprensión mutua, no hay nada, o casi nada, que pueda lograrse.
      El hecho de ser abordado por una persona que ya ha experimentado el mismo problema, el escuchar a esta persona hablar con certeza y con conocimiento de causa, el ver en su comportamiento mismo que posee la respuesta verdadera, el constatar que no se coloca en un plano de superioridad moral, que no predica para su santo y que está motivada por el deseo sincero de ayudar; el hecho de que no hay que pagar ningunos gastos, ni alabar a nadie, ni sufrir ningún reproche; reunidas todas estas condiciones hacen que el acercamiento sea más eficaz. Son numerosos quienes se han levantado de sus lechos de enfermos y reiniciado su camino después de haber sido informados por un alcohólico.
      Ninguno de nosotros consagra todo su tiempo a este trabajo y no creemos que seríamos más eficaces si lo hiciéramos. Creemos que el arar de beber es sólo el principio. Es aun más importante el poner en acción nuestros principios en nuestros propios hogares, en el trabajo y en todos nuestros actos de la vida. Todos nosotros consagramos una gran parte de nuestro tiempo libre a este tipo de servicio, del cual hablaremos posteriormente en esta obra. Algunos afortunados llegan a dedicarse casi todo el tiempo a este servicio.
      De actuar como lo hacemos, es indudable que resultaría un gran beneficio de nuestro servicio, mas el problema apenas habría aflorado a la superficie. Aquéllos de entre nosotros que viven en una gran ciudad se desaniman con la idea de que, muy cerca, centenares de alcohólicos caen en el olvido día con día. Un buen porcentaje de esos casos se resolvería si tuviesen nuestra fortuna. ¿Entonces, como ofrecerles lo que se nos ha dado tan desinteresadamente?
      Estas reflexiones nos han llevado a publicar un libro, sin nombre de autor, para exponer el problema tal como lo vemos nosotros. En él aportaremos nuestra experiencia combinada y nuestro conocimiento. Este libro deberá sugerir un programa útil para todo individuo con problemas de alcoholismo.
      Era necesario incluir en nuestro libro los aspectos de orden médico, psiquiátrico, social y religioso. Estamos conscientes de que estos temas pueden ser causa de controversias. Nada nos agradaría tanto como escribir una obra que no incluyese ningún tema de debate o de política. Haremos todo lo que podamos para alcanzar este objetivo. Todos estamos de acuerdo en que una auténtica tolerancia hacia los puntos de vista de otros, así como un profundo respeto por la opinión ajena son actitudes que bien pueden ayudarnos a lograr nuestras metas. Nuestra misma vida, la vida de un antiguo ebrio, depende de nuestro deseo de ayudar a otros y de encontrar los medios adecuados para responder a su necesidad.
      Quizás ya se pregunte usted por qué es que todos nosotros nos enfermamos tanto a causa del alcohol. Quizás sienta usted curiosidad por saber por qué y cómo — no obstante la opinión contraria de los expertos — nos hemos recuperado de una condición física y mental sin esperanza. Si usted es un alcohólico que desee liberarse del estado en que se encuentra, quizá se esté preguntando: „¿Qué debo hacer?”
      El objetivo de este libro es aportar respuestas precisas a este tipo de preguntas. Le contaremos todo lo que hemos hecho. Antes de entrar en detalles, nos parece útil exponer en forma sucinta nuestro punto de vista sobre ciertas cosas. Cuantas veces se nos ha dicho : „En cuanto al alcohol, yo puedo beberlo o no beberlo si así lo deseo. ¿Por qué tú no? Si no puedes beber razonablemente, sería mejor que no bebieras. ” „Aquél es incapaz de controlarse cuando se trata de alcohol.” „¿ Por qué no intentas beber sólo cerveza o vino?” „No tomes bebidas con alto grado de alcohol.” „De seguro, le falta voluntad.” „Si quisiera, dejaría de beber.” „Ella es una chica tan linda que por consideración él debería dejar de beber.” „El médico le dijo que si seguía bebiendo se moriría, pero está siempre achispado.”
      Estas son expresiones comunes que escuchamos a menudo. Denotan un mundo de ignorancia y de malentendidos y son las reacciones de personas que reaccionan muy diferentemente a nosotros frente al alcohol.
      Quien no bebe excesivamente no encuentra ninguna dificultad en parar de beber, si hay una buena razón para hacerlo. Puede beber o no beber, a su pleno albedrío.
      Igualmente está el caso del gran bebedor. Él puede haber bebido por mucho tiempo como para que su salud física y mental se afecte. Su vida misma puede ser corta por una muerte prematura. Sin embargo, si esta motivado por una razón suficientemente seria, como una salud precaria, una nueva relación amorosa, un cambio de ambiente o aun una seria advertencia de su médico, este bebedor será capaz, si no de cortar totalmente, sí al menos de moderar su consumo, no obstante que lo encuentre difícil y pueda aun necesitar atención médica.
      Pero ¿qué se puede decir del verdadero alcohólico. Él pudo haber iniciado siendo un bebedor moderado; después pudo convertirse o no en un gran bebedor, pero, en una cierta etapa de esta evolución, llega un momento en que no puede ya cesar de consumir alcohol a partir de que empieza a beber.
      Su comportamiento lo deja a usted perplejo. El alcohólico hace cosas absurdas, inexplicables y a veces hasta trágicas cuando bebe. Tiene una doble personalidad, como el Dr. Jekill y Mr. Hyde: Un hombre perfecto y cuando bebe, un auténtico demonio. Raramente se le encuentra ligeramente achispado, siempre está embriagado. A fuerza de beber, su carácter natural se modifica. Puede ser el hombre más amable del mundo, pero dejándolo beber se convierte en antisocial, repugnante y peligroso. Posee la cualidad de embriagarse en el momento más inoportuno, especialmente cuando es necesario tomar una decisión importante o mantener una promesa. Es a menudo un hombre lleno de equilibrio y de buen juicio en todos aspectos, pero en cuanto al alcohol es increblemente deshonesto y egoísta. Es competente, posee una habilidad, así como dotes excepcionales, y tiene ante él un carrera prometedora; se esfuerza en preparar un porvenir brillante para él y su familia, después echa todo por la borda con una serie de insensatas juergas. Es alguien que se va a dormir tan ebrio que se creería permanecerá dormido por veinticuatro horas. Sin embargo, desde que despierta al día siguiente busca ávidamente la botella que escondió la noche anterior. Si tiene los medios, será capaz de esconder el alcohol por todos lados, en los lugares menos pensados en la casa, para estar seguro de que nadie tirará su reserva total por la tubería. Cuando se agrava su estado, comienza a ingerir una combinación de potentes sedativos y alcohol para calmar sus nervios y estar en condiciones de trabajar. Llega entonces el día en que él simplemente no puede seguir así y se emborracha nuevamente. Es posible que vaya con su médico, quien le administrará morfina o algún sedante capaz de a aquéllas del hombre que se golpeara la cabeza a golpes de martillo para ya no sentir el dolor de cabeza. Si usted le hace observar a un alcohólico lo absurdo de su razonamiento, éste se burlará o se irritará y se negará a hablar.
      De vez en cuando podrá decir la verdad. Por extraño que pueda parecer, él no sabe más que usted y yo el motivo que lo empujó a tomar esa primera copa. Ciertos bebedores presentan justificaciones de las cuales algunas veces están satisfechos. Pero en el fondo de ellos mismos no saben por qué beben de esa manera. Una vez que son dominados por este mal, les sobreviene el aturdimiento. Queda entonces la idea fija de que algún día se van a curar y, por otra parte, sienten que ya han perdido la partida.
      Pocas personas se dan cuenta hasta qué punto esto es verdadero. La familia y los amigos del alcohólico sienten vagamente que éste es anormal, pero cada uno espera el día en que el enfermo despierte de su letargo y ejerza su fuerza de voluntad.
      La verdad — y esta es trágica — es que si se trata de un verdadero alcohólico, ese día puede ser que no llegue jamás. Ha perdido, en efecto, el control de su situación. Llegado a un cierto punto, el alcohólico cae en un estado en el que aun su más fuerte deseo por dejar de beber es totalmente en vano. Esta terrible situación existe en la mayor parte de los casos, mucho antes de que sea descubierta.
      El motivo es que la mayoría de los alcohólicos, por razones aún oscuras, hemos perdido la libertad de elegir ante el alcohol; aquello que nosotros llamamos fuerza de voluntad ya no existe más. A veces somos incapaces de recordar suficientemente los sufrimientos y la humillación sufridas un mes o aun una semana antes. Estamos sin defensa alguna ante la primera copa.
      Las consecuencias casi ciertas que van a seguir después de beber aun un solo vaso de cerveza no llegan a nuestra mente para detenernos. Si ocurren estos pensamientos, los mismos son vagos y prontamente son suplantados con la gastada idea de que esta vez sí no ́ vamos a manejar como las demás personas. El instinto que hace, por ejemplo, que uno se cuide de tocar una parrilla ardiendo se nos ausente totalmente.
      „Esta vez no voy a quemarme, así que ¡salud!”, se convence el alcohólico en la forma más natural de mundo. O quizás no piensa en absoluto. Cuántas veces, después de haber bebido una copa en forma distraída, no nos hemos preguntado, a la tercera o cuarta : „¿Por el amor de Dios, cómo he podido iniciar de nuevo?” Para después decirnos en seguida: „Nada más voy a tomar hasta la sexta,” o también: „De cualquier modo, no sirve de nada el intentar dejar de beber.”
      Cuando esta manera de pensar se ha fijado bien en la mente del bebedor alcohólico, todo auxilio humano probablemente será inútil, y el enfermo morirá o irá perdiendo gradualmente la razón, a menos que se le confine. Estos hechos, desagradables y brutales, han sido confirmados por legiones de alcohólicos en el curso de la historia. Si no fuera por la gracia de Dios, estaríamos contando miles de ejemplos como éste. Hay tantos bebedores que quieren parar de beber, pero que no pueden hacerlo.
      Hay una solución. A la mayoría de nosotros no nos gustaba la idea de hacer nuestro inventario, de caminar sobre nuestro amor propio, de admitir nuestras deficiencias, todas estas cosas necesarias para que el proceso de recuperación tuviese un éxito pleno. Pero vimos que esto había funcionado realmente con otros y llegamos a creer que la vida, tal como la vivíamos, era inútil y sin esperanza. Eso es porque, una vez que fuimos informados por aquéllos que habían solucionado su problema de alcohol, no nos quedaba nada más que hacer sino recoger el juego de herramientas espirituales puesto a nuestros pies. Descubrimos, por así decirlo, el paraíso y fuimos propulsados hacia una cuarta dimensión de la existencia, como jamás la hubiéramos podido imaginar.
      El hecho importante consiste simplemente en esto: Tuvimos y conocimos una experiencia espiritual profunda y eficaz que revolucionó nuestra actitud hacia la vida, hacia nuestro prójimo y todo lo que concierne a Dios. Aquello que ocupa el centro de nuestra vida de hoy es la absoluta certeza de que nuestro creador ha entrado en nuestros corazones y nuestras vidas de un modo milagroso. Ha empezado a realizar aquellas cosas que no pudimos hacer nosotros mismos.
      Si usted es un alcohólico tan gravemente enfermo como lo estuvimos nosotros, creemos que no hay medidas parciales si desea solucionar su problema. Nosotros estábamos en el punto en que la vida era imposible vivirla, y si nosotros habíamos pasado a la región de la cual ya no hay regreso a través de la ayuda humana, no teníamos más que dos alternativas: Una era seguir hasta el amargo final, destruyendo la conciencia de nuestra intolerable situación lo mejor que pudiésemos; y la otra, aceptar ayuda espiritual. Hicimos esto último porque honestamente lo queríamos y estuvimos dispuestos a hacer el esfuerzo.
      He aquí la historia de un hombre de negocios americano, muy reconocido por su talento, su juicio y su fuerte personalidad, que andaba de un psiquiátrico a otro. Había consultado a los más reconocidos psiquiatras americanos. Después se fue a Europa, poniéndose al cuidado de un célebre médico. Aunque la experiencia lo había hecho escéptico, al final de su tratamiento mostraba una fe inusitada. Su estado mental y físico eran óptimos. Sobre todo, él creía haber adquirido un conocimiento tan profundo de los mecanismos psicológicos de su mente, así como de sus activadores ocultos, que una recaída era impensable. A pesar de todo, comenzó a beber después de cierto tiempo. Lo más desconcertante era que no encontraba alguna explicación satisfactoria a su recaída.
      Regresó a ver al célebre médico, a quien admiraba mucho, y le pidió que le dijera claramente por qué no podía sanar. Deseaba, sobre todo, tener control de sí mismo. Parecía totalmente racional y bien equilibrado frente a otros problemas. Y, sin embargo, no podía controlarse ante el alcohol. ¿Cómo explicar eso?
      Le suplicó al médico que le dijera toda la verdad, y lo escuchó. Según el medico, su caso era absolutamente desesperado; jamás reencontraría su lugar en la sociedad y, si vivía muchos años, debería internarse o contratar los servicios de un guardaespaldas. Así se expresaba el renombrado médico.
      Pero este hombre aún está vivo y, además, es libre. No está confinado y tampoco necesita a un guardaespaldas. Puede ir adonde acuden los hombres libres, y sin peligro, con la condición de que acepte adoptar una determinada actitud.
      Algunos de nuestros lectores alcohólicos pudieran creer que son capaces de librarse sin una ayuda espiritual. Les presentamos aquí la conversación entre nuestro amigo y su médico :
      — Su modo de razonar es típico de un alcohólico crónico. Hasta donde sé, ninguna persona afectada como usted lo está, jamás se ha restablecido.
      Nuestro amigo tuvo la impresión de que las puertas del infierno se cerraban inexorablemente a sus espaldas. Le dijo al médico :
      — ¿Y no hay ninguna excepción?”
      — Sí — le respondió el doctor —. Ha habido excepciones en el pasado, se habla a veces de excepciones en casos como el de usted. De tiempo en tiempo, los alcohólicos han vivido lo que se llama una experiencia espiritual vital. Yo considero estos hechos como fenómenos. Se les podría catalogar como grandes transferencias y transformaciones de orden emocional. Las ideas, las emociones y las actitudes de estas personas son repentinamente hechas a un lado para dejar lugar a un conjunto de concepciones y principios enteramente nuevos que de ahí en adelante las dominará. De hecho, yo he tratado de provocar en usted este tipo de transformación emocional. Mis métodos han tenido éxito con muchas personas, pero jamás han dado resultados en un caso como el suyo.
      Estas palabras tranquilizaron un poco a nuestro amigo, quien era, desde luego, un hombre fiel a la iglesia, se decía para sí. Su esperanza se desvaneció en cuanto el médico le afirmó que a pesar la calidad de sus convicciones religiosas, éstas en su caso no podrían dar lugar a la experiencia espiritual que podría sanarlo.
      He ahí en qué terrible situación se encontraba nuestro amigo cuando vivió la experiencia extraordinaria que, como lo hemos dicho, hizo de él un hombre libre.
      Por nuestra parte, nosotros buscamos el mismo resultado, con la energía desesperada de aquél que se va ahogar. Y aquello que en el inicio semejaba ser una pequeña vara hueca de la cual asirse, resultó ser la mano de Dios. Nos fue dada una vida nueva o, si se prefiere, „un modo de vida”. El cual es verdaderamente eficaz para nosotros.
      El célebre psicólogo americano William James, en su libro „Variedades de la Experiencia Religiosa”, expone una multitud de formas en que el ser humano ha descubierto a Dios. Por parte nuestra, no hay ningún deseo de convencer a nadie de que sólo haya un camino con el cual encontrar la fe. Si lo que nosotros hemos aprendido, experimentado y visto significó algo, es que todo nosotros, de cualquier raza, credo o color, somos los hijos de un Creador vivo con quien podemos establecer una relación hecha de simplicidad y de comprensión, siempre que queramos intentar hacerlo honestamente. Aquéllos que pertenezcan a una religión no encontrarán nada que vaya contra sus convicciones o su culto. No existe ninguna fricción entre nosotros por estas cuestiones.
      Creemos que la pertenencia de nuestros miembros a cualquier grupo religioso, no nos concierne a nosotros. Para nosotros, la práctica religiosa es un asunto enteramente personal que cada quien debe regular a la luz de sus afiliaciones pasadas o de su selección actual. Además, no todos nuestros miembros se han unido a grupos religiosos, pero la mayoría ve con simpatía dicha membresía.
      En el capítulo siguiente describimos el alcoholismo tal como lo comprendemos. Después viene un capítulo dedicado a los agnósticos.
      ￼
      Entre nuestros miembros hay varias personas que una vez lo fueron. De manera sorprendente, encontramos qu dichas convicciones no representan un obstáculo serio para una experiencia espiritual.
      Más adelante explicamos muy claramente cómo hemos podido restablecernos. Vienen enseguida una serie de testimonios personales. Cada alcohólico relata en ellos, con sus propias palabras y según su punto de vista, la forma en que se puso en contacto con Dios. Los autores de estos relatos son representativos de nuestros miembros y dan una descripción fiel de lo que ocurrió en la vida de cada uno de ellos.
      Esperamos que estas revelaciones íntimas no sean consideradas de mal gusto. Es nuestro deseo más grande que muchos alcohólicos, hombres y mujeres, lean estas páginas; estamos firmemente convencidos de que, solamente revelándonos nosotros mismos con nuestros problemas, los persuadiremos para que digan : „Si, yo soy como ellos; necesito obtener lo que ellos ya tienen .”

    - EL ALCOHOLISMO
    - |
      La mayoría de nosotros rechazaba admitir que éramos verdaderos alcohólicos. En efecto, no es agradable para nadie pensar que mentalmente y físicamente se es diferente a los demás. No es entonces de extrañar que nuestras vidas de bebedores hayan estado marcadas por innumerables e inútiles tentativas para demostrar que podíamos beber como todo el mundo. Ésta es la gran obsesión de todo bebedor anormal : la idea de que algún día — y él no sabe cómo — llegará a beber razonablemente y a encontrar placer al hacerlo. Es asombroso constatar hasta qué punto puede persistir esta ilusión. Son muchos los que se aferraron a ella hasta las puertas de la locura o de la muerte.
      Aprendimos a aceptar, hasta lo más profundo de nuestro ser, que éramos alcohólicos. Éste era el primer paso a tomar si queríamos liberarnos. La ilusión de que somos como los demás — o que alguna día lo llegaremos a ser — debe disiparse de inmediato.
      Nosotros, hombres y mujeres alcohólicos, hemos perdido la facultad de controlarnos ante el alcohol. Sabemos que un alcohólico verdadero jamás encuentra este control. Claro que sí, todos nosotros tuvimos, en un momento determinado, la impresión de que nos reponíamos. Pero estos respiros, generalmente cortos, eran seguidos por una impotencia todavía más grande que traía un abatimiento lastimoso e incomprensible. Estamos convencidos de que los alcohólicos de nuestra categoría somos presa de una enfermedad progresiva. A la larga, nuestro estado se agrava sin cesar, jamás se mejora.
      El alcohólico es como el inválido que no tiene ya piernas: jamás las va a recuperar. No parece existir ningún tratamiento capaz de transformar en seres normales a los alcohólicos como nosotros. Hemos probado todos los remedios posibles, y a veces algunos nos han dado un momento de respiro. Mas siempre les seguía la aparición de un estado aun más grave que los anteriores. Los médicos que conocen el alcoholismo están de acuerdo en que es imposible para un alcohólico convertirse en un bebedor normal. Quizás algún día la ciencia aporte tal remedio, pero hasta ahora esto no es posible.
      A pesar de lo que podamos decir, numerosos son los verdaderos alcohólicos que no creen pertenecer a esta categoría. Ellos se dejan llevar por una esperanza engañosa y tratan por todos los medios de demostrarse que son las excepciones a la regla y que son, por consiguiente, bebedores normales. Estamos dispuestos a quitarnos el sombrero ante la persona que, habiendo demostrado una sola vez que era incapaz de controlar el alcohol, pudiese posteriormente consumirlo de manera normal. Sólo Dios sabe los numerosos y pacientes esfuerzos que hemos hecho por intentar beber ¡ como todo el mundo !
      He aquí algunos de los métodos que intentamos: Beber solamente cerveza; limitar el numero de copas; nunca beber solos; nunca beber por las mañanas; beber solamente en nuestra casa; no tener alcohol en casa; no beber durante las horas de trabajo; beber solamente en compromisos sociales; cambiar de whisky a brandy; beber solamente vino; estar de acuerdo en presentar nuestra renuncia si llegábamos a emborracharnos en el trabajo; salir de viaje; dejar de salir de viaje; jurar o simplemente prometer que no volveríamos a beber; hacer más ejercicio físico; leer obras literarias adecuadas para encontrar motivación; pasar algún tiempo en una finca de reposo en el campo o en alguna clínica; estar de acuerdo en recibir tratamiento psiquiátrico. La lista podría aumentarse hasta el infinito.
      No nos gusta declarar que una persona es alcohólica; usted mismo puede elaborar su propio diagnóstico:
      Entre al bar más cercano y vea si puede beber razonablemente. Asimismo, ensaye beber y detenerse súbitamente. Repita el experimento varias veces. Pronto sabrá a qué atenerse si es honesto consigo mismo. Quizás valga la pena arriesgarse a padecer un brutal acceso de temblores, con tal de saber con seguridad cuál es nuestro estado.
      Aunque no estemos en condiciones de comprobarlo, creemos que la mayoría de nosotros habríamos podido poner fin a nuestro mal hábito desde el principio. Sin embargo, pocos alcohólicos desean verdaderamente dejar de beber cuando aún es tiempo. Hemos tomado algunos casos de individuos que, a pesar de la manifestación indudable de todos los signos de alcoholismo, tuvieron éxito al no beber durante mucho tiempo gracias a un poderoso deseo de dejar de hacerlo. Les damos aquí un ejemplo:
      Un hombre de treinta años se emborrachaba mucho y muy seguido. Por las mañanas se sentía excesivamente nervioso e intentaba calmarse bebiendo otra vez alcohol. Además deseaba ardientemente triunfar en los negocios, pero se daba cuenta de que no lograría nada bueno mientras hiciera contacto con el alcohol, pues, una vez que empezaba a beber, ya no podía detenerse. Tomó entonces la decisión de no tomar ni una sola gota de alcohol hasta que hubiese triunfado en la vida y viviera retirado de los negocios. Con una fuerza excepcional, este hombre permaneció perfectamente abstemio durante veinticinco años y, despuésde haber triunfado en el mundo de los negocios, se retiró a los cincuenta y cinco. Como casi todos los alcohólicos, cometió el error de creer que, en razón de su larga abstinencia y de su disciplina personal, podría beber como los demás. Se puso sus pantuflas y abrió una botella. Dos meses más tarde llegó a un hospital confundido y humillado. Durante algún tiempo hizo esfuerzos para regular su modo de beber, al tiempo que se internaba varias veces en el hospital. Poco después, reuniendo todo el coraje de que era capaz, intentó cesar de beber completamente, sólo para descubrir que no podía. Sin fijarse en gastos, consiguió todos los medios posibles para combatir su hábito; pero todas sus tentativas fracasaron. De complexión robusta en su retiro, su físico decayó gravemente y murió cuatro años más tarde.
      Hay en esta historia una lección importante. La mayoría de nosotros creímos que, no bebiendo durante un buen tiempo, podríamos enseguida beber normalmente. Pero aquí está un hombre que, a los cincuenta y cinco años, se encontraba en el punto exacto en que estaba a los treinta. Vimos demostrada una vez más esta verdad : „Una vez alcohólico, alcohólico para siempre.” Cuando, después de un período de abstinencia, regresamos al alcohol, estamos en el mismo estado grave que antes. Si queremos renunciar a beber, debemos hacerlo sin ninguna reserva, sin acariciar la sutil esperanza de estar algún día inmunizados contra el alcohol.
      Quienes son jóvenes pueden llegar a creer, a partir de la experiencia de este hombre, que pueden detenerse, como él lo hizo, por medio de la sola voluntad. Dudamos mucho que puedan tener éxito, ya que no lo desean firmemente. A causa de la particular deformación mental del alcohólico, ninguno tendrá éxito. Un gran número de miembros de nuestra agrupación, personas de treinta años o menos, habían bebido sólo durante unos pocos años; sin embargo, se encontraron tan desprotegidos como aquéllos que habían bebido durante veinte años.
      No es necesario haber bebido mucho tiempo ni haber ingerido las mismas cantidades de alcohol que nosotros para estar gravemente afectado. Esto es particularmente cierto para las mujeres. Las mujeres del tipo alcohólico son a menudo atacadas por la enfermedad de manera súbita y llegan al punto de no retorno en pocos años. Ciertos bebedores, que se sentirían insultados por ser considerados como alcohólicos, se asombran de su incapacidad para cesar su consumo de alcohol. Nosotros, que estamos familiarizados con los síntomas de esta enfermedad, encontramos que entre los jóvenes hay un gran número de alcohólicos potenciales, por donde quiera que los observemos. Pero... ¡trate usted de que ellos se den cuenta!
      Al lanzar una mirada al pasado, nos parece que seguimos bebiendo
      ￼
      mucho tiempo después de que pasamos el punto donde pudimos parar sólo con nuestra voluntad. A aquél que se pregunte si ya franqueó ese límite, nosotros le sugerimos que ensaye abstenerse de alcohol durante un año. Si es un alcohólico verdadero y su alcoholismo está muy avanzado, tiene pocas probabilidades de tener éxito. En los primeros tiempos en que empezamos a beber, todas las veces teníamos éxito en no beber alcohol por un año o más; después nos convertimos en bebedores crónicos. Aunque, si una persona puede dejar de beber por un corto tiempo, puede ser ya un alcohólico potencial. Estamos convencidos de que será poco probable que aquéllos a quienes les interese este libro puedan dejar de beber durante un año. Algunos de ellos estarán ebrios al día siguiente de que tomen esa resolución; la mayoría beberá en las siguientes semanas.
      Aquéllos que son incapaces de beber moderadamente, se preguntarán cómo podrían de dejar de hacerlo completamente. Damos por descontado, desde luego, que el lector desea dejar de beber. Para saber si alguien puede hacerlo sin una ayuda espiritual, es necesario saber hasta qué punto ha perdido la capacidad de elegir si va a continuar o no bebiendo. Fuimos muchos los que pensábamos que teníamos la fuerza de carácter necesaria para poder hacerlo. Sentíamos la necesidad absoluta de renunciar al alcohol para siempre. Y, sin embargo, nos fue imposible hacerlo. El alcoholismo, ahora lo sabemos, posee esta característica desconcertante, tal como la conocemos nosotros: no se le puede dejar, no importa lo grande de la necesidad o el deseo.
      Entonces, ¿qué debemos hacer para ayudar a nuestros lectores a determinar por sí solos, y por su propio interés, si son de los nuestros? El tratar de renunciar al alcohol durante un cierto tiempo es útil; sin embargo, creemos tener un medio mejor para ayudar a aquéllos que sufren de alcoholismo y, quizá también, a los médicos. Por esto vamos a describir algunos de los estados mentales que preceden a una recaída, pues es evidente que es ahí donde está el fondo del problema.
      ¿Qué pasa en la cabeza de un alcohólico que repite y repite la experiencia fatal de la primera copa? Sus amigos que intentaron hacerlo razonar después de una borrachera que lo ha llevado casi al borde del divorcio o de la quiebra, se quedan siempre desconcertados al verlo tomar de nuevo el camino al bar. ¿Qué hace? ¿En qué piensa? Nuestro primer ejemplo es el de un hombre al que llamaremos Jim. Además de tener una esposa y unos hijos encantadores, Jim heredó una exitosa concesionaria de automóviles y su pasado — como soldado de la Primera Guerra Mundial — es de lo mejor. Tiene éxito en las ventas. Goza de la estima de todos. Hasta donde se le puede juzgar, es un hombre inteligente, pero de carácter nervioso. Estuvo abstemio hasta la edad de treinta y cinco años. Al paso de pocos años, sus excesos de alcohol lo hicieron violento hasta el punto que se le tuvo que internar. A su salida del psiquiátrico, se puso en contacto con nosotros.       Le participamos lo que sabíamos del alcoholismo y de la solución
      que habíamos encontrado. Él decidió intentar. Se volvió a unir a su familia y obtuvo un puesto de vendedor en la empresa que él había perdido a causa del alcohol. Todo marchó bien por un cierto tiempo; sin embargo, él no hizo nada por enriquecer su vida espiritual. Con todo su asombro, se emborrachó seis veces en poco tiempo. Después de cada una de estas recaídas, nosotros trabajábamos con él, tratando de investigar qué había ocurrido. Reconoció que realmente era alcohólico y que su estado era grave. Sabía que lo esperaba otra curación en el hospital psiquiátrico, si hubiese continuado. Además, perdería a su familia, por la que sentía tanto afecto.
      A pesar de todo, volvió a beber. Le pedimos que nos relatara exactamente como habían ocurrido las cosas. He aquí su relato: „Me presenté a trabajar el martes por la mañana. Recuerdo que estaba en un estado de irritación debido a la idea de que no era más que un vendedor del negocio que antes me había pertenecido. Tuve una diferencia con el dueño, pero nada serio. Enseguida decidí visitar a uno de mis clientes que vivía en el campo y que quizás se interesaría en comprar un coche nuevo. Durante el trayecto, y debido a que sentía hambre, me detuve en un restaurante donde también había un bar. No tenía ninguna intención de beber. Quería comer sólo un emparedado. Medité en que quizás podría encontrar ahí a algún otro cliente conocido, pues frecuentaba esta clase de lugares desde hacía varios años. Había ido a ese lugar por varios meses, desde que dejé de beber. Me senté en una mesa y pedí un emparedado y un vaso de leche. Hasta ese momento no llegó a mi mente la idea de beber. Pedí otro emparedado y decidí tomar otro vaso de leche.
      „Repentinamente me pasó por la cabeza la idea de que si le pusiera un dedal de whisky a mi leche, no me haría daño, ya que tenía el estómago lleno. Ordené el whisky y se lo añadí a la leche. Tuve la vaga idea de que no estaba siendo prudente, pero me tranquilizó el estar tomando el whisky con el estómago lleno. La cosa iba tan bien que ordené otro whisky, que naturalmente vacié en otro vaso de leche. Como me parecía que no me hacía mal, pedí otro.
      Fue así como Jim tuvo que irse de nuevo al hospital. Aquí estaba la amenaza de internarlo, de perder su trabajo, su familia; y ya no digamos los sufrimientos morales y físicos que el alcohol siempre le causaba. Que estaba bien informado sobre su condición de alcohólico, lo estaba. No obstante, todas las razones que tenía para no beber fueron fácilmente descartadas con la idea insensata de que podría tomar whisky sin peligro, ¡nada más si lo mezclaba con leche!
      Como quiera que se le llame, no importa. Para nosotros, ésa es locura, simple y llanamente. ¿Cómo podríamos llamar de otra manera a una falta de juicio tal, a una falta de pensamiento tal?
      Quizás crea usted que se trata de un caso extremo. Para nosotros es algo común, ya que esta manera de pensar ha sido característica en cada uno de nosotros. Hemos reflexionado acerca de estos hechos más de lo que Jim lo hizo. Pero nosotros éramos siempre las víctimas de un curioso fenómeno mental: paralelamente a nuestros argumentos sensatos, algunos pretextos tan aberrantes como ridículos se nos ponían enfrente para justificarnos al tomar la primera copa. Todos nuestros demás razonamientos no bastaban para parar de beber. Estas ideas insanas siempre triunfaban. Al día siguiente nos preguntábamos, con toda sinceridad y honestidad, cómo había podido suceder todo eso.
      En otras circunstancias, deliberadamente nos emborrachamos, creyendo estar justificados por los nervios, la cólera, la inquietud, la depresión, los celos o algún otro sentimiento de este género. Pero, aun en esta clase de inicio, debemos aceptar que a esta justificación le faltaba cualquier base razonable, desde el momento en que todo terminaba de ese modo. Nos dábamos cuenta ahora de que, aun cuando comenzábamos a beber deliberadamente, y no en forma fortuita, no habíamos reflexionado seriamente en las enormes consecuencias que iban a resultar.
      Nuestra forma de comportarnos ante la primera copa es tan absurda e incomprensible como la de aquél que acostumba atravesar la calle cuando hay un tráfico incesante. Buscando emociones fuertes, le encanta esquivar a los coches. Y a pesar de las advertencias de sus amigos bien intencionados, se divierte con este jueguito durante años. Hasta este punto, él pasa como un individuo loco con ideas muy extrañas sobre cómo divertirse. Pero un día la suerte lo abandona y se lastima ligeramente varias veces consecutivas. Una persona normal dejaría a un lado esta peligrosa manía. Pero ahí lo tenemos, atropellado nuevamente por un vehículo, mas esta vez le fracturaron el cráneo. En el curso de la siguiente semana, al salir del hospital, un tranvía le rompe un brazo. Él le dice a usted que ha resuelto no volver a lanzarse jamás al arroyo de la calle, pero, al cabo de unas semanas, lo encontramos con las dos piernas fracturadas.
      Y por años y años continúa comportándose así — prometiendo continuamente que será prudente y que ya no volverá a atravesar la calle. Finalmente, ya no puede volver a trabajar. Su esposa se divorcia de él y nuestro amigo se convierte en el hazmerreír de todos. Intenta todas las soluciones para quitar de su mente esta manía. Se hace internar en un hospital psiquiátrico, con la esperanza de salir curado. Pero el día en que deja el hospital, se precipita contra un camión de bomberos que le rompe la columna. Es necesario estar loco para actuar de este modo, ¿no cree usted ?
      ¿Considera usted que este ejemplo es demasiado exagerado o casi ridículo? ¿Le parece así? Nosotros, que hemos pasado por duras pruebas, estamos obligados a admitir que se podría contar la misma historia, sustituyendo esta pasión por el peligro con el hábito de beber. La narración nos describiría exactamente. A pesar de todo lo expertos e inteligentes que podamos ser en otros campos, por lo que respecta al alcohol somos personas que nos comportamos verdaderamente como seres afectados por locura. Es muy crudo hablar así, pero ¿no es cierto?
      Algunos de ustedes pensarán: „Sí, eso que nos dice es verdad, pero no se aplica enteramente a nuestro caso. Estamos de acuerdo en que presentamos algunos de esos síntomas, mas no hemos llegado a los extremos de ustedes y hay pocas probabilidades de que nos ocurra igual, pues luego de oír lo que se nos ha contado, hemos entendido muy bien el peligro de nuestra situación y no vamos a exponernos a que esas cosas nos ocurran. El alcohol no nos ha hecho perder todo en la vida y, además, no tenemos la intención de llegar hasta ese punto. ¡Gracias por la información!”
      Este razonamiento es válido para ciertas personas que no sean alcohólicas y que, aunque beban desordenadamente, pueden parar de beber o disminuir la cantidad de alcohol, debido a que sus mentes y su físico no se han dañado tanto como ha ocurrido con nosotros. Pero el verdadero alcohólico, o aquél que está por serlo, sin excepción será absolutamente incapaz de cesar de beber por el simple hecho de que tenga un cierto conocimiento de sí mismo. Queremos insistir en este punto una y otra vez para que pueda entrar en la cabeza de nuestros lectores alcohólicos, ya que esta verdad la hemos aprendido pagando al precio de crueles experiencias. Pasemos ahora a otro caso.
      Fred es socio de una importante firma de contadores públicos. Sus ingresos son muy altos, posee una bella casa. Es feliz en su matrimonio y sus hijos estudian una carrera prometedora en la universidad. Es una persona tan agradable que tiene amistades por doquier. Fred es el perfecto ejemplo del hombre de negocios que ha triunfado. Da la impresión de ser estable, bien equilibrado. Sin embargo, es alcohólico. Conocimos a Fred hace uno año en el hospital donde se recuperaba de una crisis de convulsión alcohólica. Era la primera vez que le ocurría y se sentía muy avergonzado. Lejos, muy lejos de admitir que era un alcohólico, decía que había llegado al hospital para atenderse de agotamiento. El médico le hizo comprender en tono enérgico que su enfermedad era más grave de lo que él pensaba. Durante algunos días, esta noticia lo deprimió. Decidió renunciar completamente al alcohol. Jamás le llegó a su mente que, a pesar de su fuerza de carácter y su posición social, no lo podría lograr. Fred no sólo se rehusó a reconocer que era alcohólico, y hubiese estado aun menos dispuesto a aceptar una solución espiritual a su problema. Le expusimos lo que sabíamos sobre alcoholismo. Interesándose, reconoció que presentaba algunos de los síntomas; pero estaba lejos de admitir que no iba a poder salir por sí solo. Estaba seguro de que después de aquella experiencia humillante y después de las nociones aprendidas al respecto, éstas bastarían para mantenerlo a salvo por el resto de sus días. El conocimiento de sí mismo resolvería su problema.
      Por un cierto tiempo no tuvimos más noticias de Fred. Un día nos enteramos de que había sido de nuevo hospitalizado. Esta vez padecía severas convulsiones y prontamente dio instrucciones de que necesitaba vernos. La historia que nos contó es una de las más instructivas, porque habla de un hombre convencido de que debía dejar el alcohol, que había dado pruebas de poseer un ingenio y una determinación extraordinarios en todos sus actos y que — no obstante — estaba ahí, en una cama, postrado.
      Escuchemos su historia: „Me quedé muy impresionado por lo que ustedes me habían dicho del alcoholismo y creía sinceramente que era imposible que yo volviera a beber. Había tomado debida nota de sus advertencias en cuanto se refiere a la locura súbita que se apodera de la mente ante la primera copa; mas tenía la certeza, con todos los conocimientos adquiridos, que eso no me podría ocurrir. Me decía que mi caso era menos grave que el de ustedes; que tal como resolvía mis problemas personales, yo triunfaría ahí donde ustedes habían fracasado. Me parecía que tenía toda la razón en tener confianza y que bastaba tener voluntad y mantenerme alerta.
      „Volví a mis negocios con aquel estado de ánimo y por un cierto tiempo todo funcionó bien. No tenía ningún problema para rechazar el alcohol, pero empecé a pensar que si no había exagerado la gravedad de mi caso. Un día tuve que ir a Washington para presentar una información contable a una oficina del gobierno. Tenía la oportunidad de viajar desde que había cesado de beber: entonces no había nada de nuevo para mí en ese viaje. Me sentía bien físicamente y no había tenido problemas urgentes ni preocupaciones. Mi cita de negocios había sido todo un éxito. Estaba contento y pensaba que mis socios también lo estarían. Un día perfecto llegaba a su fin, no había nubes en el horizonte. „ Fui a mi hotel y tranquilamente me cambié de ropa para la cena. Cuando pasé el umbral del comedor me vino la idea de que podría acompañar mis alimentos con unos cuantos cocteles. Esto fue todo y nada más. Ordené entonces una bebida y mi cena. Después pedí que me trajeran otra copa. Después de la cena decidí ir a pasear. A mi regreso al hotel pensé que beber algo me haría bien antes de irme a la cama. Me dirigí al bar y tomé un, de no ser por una ayuda divina, ustedes no tenían la más leve esperanza. Si me hubiesen pedido tratarlos en mi hospital, no los habría admitido, si me hubiese sido posible hacer eso. Los enfermos como ustedes son personas verdaderamente trágicas. Yo no soy muy religioso, pero tengo un profundo respeto por su método, el cual busca curar el espíritu en casos similares al suyo. En la mayoría de los casos no existe otra solución.”
      Lo repetimos una vez más: El alcohólico, en ciertos periodos de su existencia, no posee ninguna defensa mental contra la primera copa. Salvo casos excepcionales, ni él ni ningún otro ser humano puede proporcionarle los medios para defenderse. El auxilio debe venir de un Poder Superior.

    - NOSOTROS, LOS AGNÓSTICOS
    - "En los capítulos precedentes le hemos expuesto a usted los hechos que, así
      lo esperamos, le permitirán establecer claramente la distinción entre quien
      es alcohólico y quien no lo es. Si no puede renunciar al alcohol aunque lo desee
      sinceramente, o si es incapaz de detenerse cuando bebe, entonces es probable
      que usted sea alcohólico. Si este es el caso, su mal podría ser de aquéllos
      que sólo pueden ser vencidos por una experiencia espiritual.\nUna experiencia
      de este género le puede parecer imposible a un ateo o a un agnóstico. Sin embargo,
      no hacer nada significa correr a la catástrofe, sobre todo si se es un alcohólico
      cuyo caso no presenta esperanza. Hacer frente a la disyuntiva entre morir de
      alcoholismo o vivir sobre una base espiritual no siempre es fácil.\nPero esto
      no es tan difícil. Alrededor de la mitad de nuestros primeros miembros se encontraban
      en este caso. Al principio, algunos trataban de evadir el tema esperando, contra
      toda evidencia, que no fuesen verdaderos alcohólicos. Entonces, después de cierto
      tiempo tuvieron que aceptar el hecho de que debían de dar a su vida un fundamento
      espiritual, o si no... Quizás sea el caso de usted. Pero, anímese, ya que algo
      así como cincuenta de nosotros nos creíamos ateos o agnósticos. Nuestra experiencia
      comprueba que usted no debe desconcertarse.\nSi un sencillo código moral o una
      mejor filosofía fuesen suficientes para vencer el alcoholismo, muchísimos de
      nosotros ya nos hubiéramos aliviado desde hace mucho tiempo. Sin embargo, la
      ética y las filosofías no nos salvaron a pesar de todos los intentos que hicimos.
      De hecho, quisimos ser de una moralidad perfecta; quisimos con todo el corazón
      aferrarnos a una cierta filosofía; mas no tuvimos la fuerza necesaria. Nuestras
      posibilidades humanas, guiadas por nuestra voluntad, no eran suficientes; fracasamos
      lamentablemente.\nNuestra impotencia nos planteaba un verdadero dilema: teníamos
      que encontrar una fuerza gracias a la cual pudiésemos vivir, y ésta debía ser
      un Poder Superior a nosotros mismos, evidentemente. ¿Pero dónde y cómo encontrar
      este Poder?\nLa búsqueda de tal fuerza es justamente el tema de este libro.
      Su fin principal es conducirlo a descubrir un Poder Superior a usted mismo que
      le ayude a resolver su problema. Hemos escrito un libro que — según lo creemos
      — es tanto espiritual como moral. Eso quiere decir, de seguro, que vamos a hablar
      de Dios. Y ¡qué dificultad para los agnósticos! En cuanto nos ponemos a hablar
      con un recién llegado, vemos enseguida la esperanza dibujarse en su rostro cuando
      platicamos sobre su alcoholismo y cuando le explicamos cómo funciona nuestra
      agrupación. Pero vemos que su semblante se ensombrece cuando se toca la espiritualidad
      y, sobre todo, cuando mencionamos el nombre de Dios, pues acabamos de recordarle
      un tema que creía haber evadido totalmente, y que no tenía que tomar en cuenta
      por el resto de sus días.\nSabemos lo que siente. Como él, tuvimos prejuicios
      y dudamos sinceramente. Algunos de nosotros se han mostrado violentamente antirreligiosos.
      Para otros, la palabra „Dios” evocaba una idea peculiar de Aquél que se les
      había tratado de imponer durante su infancia. Quizás nosotros rechazamos esta
      concepción particular porque nos parecía vacía. Creímos así haber abandonado
      por completo la idea de Dios. Creer en una fuerza exterior y depender de ella
      nos parecía una prueba de debilidad y hasta de falta de coraje. Esta idea nos
      disgustaba. Mirábamos con profundo escepticismo este mundo de individuos en
      guerra, de religiones enemigas, de calamidades inexplicables. Mirábamos con
      desprecio a las personas que se decían piadosas. ¿Cómo podría un Ser Supremo
      estar mezclado con todo eso? Y de todas maneras ¿quién podría entender a una
      entidad semejante? Sin embargo, bajo el encanto de un cielo estrellado, por
      ejemplo, llegaba a nuestra mente la necesidad de preguntarnos: „Pero, ¿quién
      creó todo esto?” Estábamos por un momento llenos de admiración y maravillados,
      pero no era más que una impresión pasajeraombre práctico de hoy exige hechos
      y resultados. El siglo XX está abierto a toda clase de teorías, pero éstas deben
      estar fundamentadas sobre hechos concretos. Por ejemplo, numerosas son las teorías
      sobre la electricidad. Todo el mundo las acepta sin la menor duda, sin discutir.
      ¿Por qué? Simplemente porque es imposible explicar lo que se ve, lo que se siente,
      lo que se dirige o lo que se utiliza, sin una hipótesis válida como punto de
      partida.\nEn nuestros días, todo el mundo cree en una multitud de cosas consideradas
      como evidentes, pero de las cuales no existe ninguna prueba tangible irrevocable.
      Y ¿la ciencia no nos enseña acaso que no hay una prueba menos sólida que lo
      que llamamos justamente una prueba tangible? En el estudio que el hombre hace
      del mundo material, está invariablemente demostrado que las apariencias no corresponden
      del todo a la realidad intrínseca. Aquí tenemos un ejemplo:\nToda viga de acero
      consiste en una masa de electrones que gravitan alrededor de un núcleo a una
      velocidad inimaginable. Esos corpúsculos se rigen por leyes precisas, que son
      las mismas para todo el universo de la materia. Eso es lo que la ciencia nos
      enseña, y no tenemos ninguna razón para dudar. Por otro lado, en cuanto se nos
      pide considerar que el origen de este mundo material y de esta vida, tales como
      los vemos, es obra de una inteligencia creadora, directora y todopoderosa, de
      inmediato nuestros perversos instintos salen a la superficie y nos las ingeniamos
      para persuadirnos de lo inverosímil de esta hipótesis. Leemos enormes volúmenes
      y nos enfrascamos en discusiones sin sentido, opinando que creemos que no hay
      necesidad de Dios para dar una explicación del universo. Si nuestras suposiciones
      estuvieran fundadas, la vida no tendría un origen, no significaría nada y no
      llevaría a ninguna parte.\nEn lugar de reconocer que somos sólo los agentes
      inteligentes y las puntas de lanza de un universo siempre en evolución y creado
      por Dios, nosotros — agnósticos y ateos — habíamos escogido creer que la inteligencia
      humana era la primera y la última palabra; el alfa y el omega del universo.
      Un poco pretencioso. ¿No lo cree usted?\nNosotros, que recorrimos ese camino
      tortuoso, le suplicamos hacer a un lado todos sus prejuicios, aun aquéllos contra
      las organizaciones religiosas. Aunque algunas no lo suficientemente humanas,
      descubrimos que las religiones han ofrecido a millones de personas un fin y
      una dirección a seguir. Los fieles de estas religiones llevan una vida razonable.
      Nosotros, ninguna. Nos divertíamos al escandalizarnos con cinismo de las diversas
      creencias religiosas, cuando a veces pudimos haber observado que en los creyentes
      de cualquier raza, color o fe religiosa había una estabilidad y una felicidad
      por sentirse útiles. A estos valores nos debimos haber acercado nosotros mismos.\nPreferíamos
      interesarnos en las debilidades humanas de esas personas y, a veces, nos apoyábamos
      sobre sus deficiencias para condenarlos en masa. Hablábamos de intolerancia,
      cuando nosotros mismos éramos intolerantes. Nos privábamos de la realidad y
      de la belleza del bosque, al dejarnos distraer por la fealdad de algún árbol
      decrépito. No habíamos mirado el aspecto espiritual de la vida con la debida
      honestidad.\nEn nuestros testimonios individuales encontrará muchas formas de
      abordar y concebir un Poder Superior a usted mismo. Poco importa la forma de
      acercarse a la idea particular de Dios a la cual adherirse; la experiencia nos
      ha enseñado que, para nuestros fines, no debemos preocuparnos por esto. Cada
      individuo debe solucionar por sí mismo este problema.\nSin embargo, en un punto
      los hombres y las mujeres están de acuerdo en forma notable: todos ellos han
      encontrado un Poder Superior y todos ellos creen. Y este Poder Superior, en
      todo caso, ha operado el milagro, lo humanamente imposible. Como lo dijo un
      famoso estadista americano: «Veamos la historia».\nUn ciento de hombres y mujeres,
      de carne y hueso, afirman categóricamente que después de haber llegado a creer
      en un Poder Superior a ellos mismos, de haber adoptado una cierta actitud hacia
      este Poder y de haber aceptado hacer unas cosas simplísimas, una transformación
      se operó en su forma de vivir y de pensar. Al borde de la desesperación, del
      colapso y del fracaso total de sus recursos humanos, se sintieron invadidos
      por un sentimiento de fuerza, de paz, de dicha y de certeza. Este cambio se
      produjo poco tiempo después que aceptaron, de buen grado, llenar ciertas exigencias.
      \nConfusos y desconcertados como estaban ante la futilidad aparente de la existencia,
      vieron las razones profundas de su dificultad de vivir. Haciendo a un lado la
      cuestión del alcohol, ellos explican por qué su vida era tan insatisfactoria.
      Nos muestran cómo se produjo en ellos el cambio. Una vez que cientos de personas
      pueden afirmar que la conciencia de la Presencia de Dios es ahora lo más importante
      de su vida, tenemos una fuerte motivación para creer.\nEl mundo que nos rodea
      hizo más progresos sobre el plano material en el curso del último siglo que
      durante todos los milenios precedentes. Casi todos conocen la razón. Aquéllos
      interesados en la historia nos dicen que, intelectualmente, los hombres de la
      antigüedad eran iguales a las más grandes mentes de nuestro tiempo. Sin embargo,
      en la antigüedad el progreso material era de una lentitud penosa. Los métodos
      de investigación y el espíritu de invención de la ciencia eran casi desconocidos.
      En lo que se refiere a lo material, el espíritu del hombre estaba aprisionado
      por las supersticiones, las tradiciones y toda clase de ideas establecidas.
      En tiempos de Cristóbal Colón, muchos consideraron una locura creer que la Tierra
      fuese redonda. Otros llegaron hasta el punto de condenar a muerte al sabio Galileo
      por las herejías que propagaba en materia de astronomía.\nNosotros nos hemos
      preguntado si algunos de nosotros no éramos tan prejuiciosos e irracionales
      en relación con el aspecto espiritual, como las personas de la antigüedad en
      relación con lo material. Asimismo, en el curso del siglo que vivimos, los diarios
      americanos han titubeado en publicar la crónica del primer vuelo aéreo realizado
      con éxito por los hermanos Wright en Kittyhawk. ¿No habían fracasado todos los
      vuelos anteriores? ¿No se había caído la máquina voladora del profesor Langley
      al fondo del Potomac? ¿Acaso los mejores matemáticos no habían demostrado que
      el hombre jamás podría volar? ¿No se había comprendido ya que Dios había reservado
      ese privilegio a los pájaros? Apenas treinta años más tarde, la conquista del
      cielo casi se había convertido en historia antigua y la aviación estaba en su
      pleno apogeo.\nNuestra generación ha sido testigo de una liberación total del
      pensamiento. Si le enseñamos a un estibador de puerto un periódico dominical
      en donde se hable de un viaje a la luna en un cohete, él nos dirá: „Apuesto
      que lo harán y en poco tiempo.” Nuestra época se caracteriza por la facilidad
      con que abandonamos viejas ideas por nuevas. Sin muchos problemas nos desembarazamos
      de una teoría o de una cosa que no funciona, en provecho de una cosa nueva que
      sí funcione.\nNos hemos preguntado si no podríamos tomar la misma actitud frente
      a nuestros problemas humanos y aceptar cambiar también nuestros puntos de vista.
      Teníamos dificultades en nuestras relaciones personales; no podíamos controlar
      nuestra naturaleza emocional; éramos presas de la tristeza y la depresión; éramos
      incapaces de ganarnos la vida, no le encontrábamos ningún objetivo a nuestra
      existencia; éramos presas del miedo; éramos desdichados; no creíamos poder hacer
      nada por los demás. Entonces, ¿no era más importante encontrar un remedio de
      largo plazo a nuestras frustraciones que estar viendo en los diarios las columnas
      sobre los vuelos a la luna? Claro que sí.\nUna vez que vimos a otros resolver
      sus problemas simplemente mediante su confianza en el Espíritu del Universo,
      no pudimos hacer otra cosa que ya no dudar en el poder de Dios. Nuestras ideas
      nos llevaban a la nada. La idea de Dios funcionaba.\nFue su fe ingenua lo que
      llevó a los hermanos Wright a creer que podrían construir una máquina voladora.
      Y triunfaron. Sin esta confianza, no habrían hecho nada. Nosotros, agnósticos
      y ateos, vivíamos convencidos de que podríamos resolver nuestros problemas con
      sólo nuestro poder. Cuando otros nos enseñaron que habían podido salir adelante
      gracias al Poder de Dios, empezamos a sentirnos un poco como aquéllos que habían
      pensado a principios de siglo que los hermanos Wright jamás podrían volar.\nLa
      lógica es una gran cosa. Nos gustaba y nos sigue gustando. No es por casualidad
      que se nos haya favorecido con la facultad de razonar, de examinar los mensajes
      de nuestros sentidos y de sacar conclusiones. Ése es uno de los maravillosos
      atributos del hombre. A causa de nuestro agnosticismo, no nos satisfacían las
      proposiciones que no se prestasen a un estudio y una interpretación racionales.
      Por eso es que estamos haciendo todo lo posible para explicar por qué nuestra
      fe es racional, por qué nosotros encontramos más sno y más lógico creer que
      no creer, por qué nuestra antigua forma de pensar era descuidada, indolente,
      y encogíamos los hombros con aire de incredulidad y decíamos : „¡No sé!”\nPara
      nosotros los alcohólicos, atormentados por una crisis profunda de la cual éramos
      los primeros responsables y de la cual no podíamos escapar, fue necesario examinar
      sin temor la afirmación dequeDiosestodooÉlesnada,dequeDiosesoÉlnoes.¿Cuáliba
      a ser nuestra selección?\nReunidos en este punto, nos encontrábamos frente al
      problema de la fe. Imposible evitarlo. Algunos ya habían saltado sobre el Puente
      de la Razón, hacia la playa deseada de la Fe. La Tierra Prometida había hecho
      brillar los ojos cansados de quien se consumía en su espíritu, proporcionándole
      un nuevo ánimo. Manos amigas se extendían hacia nosotros, dándonos la bienvenida.
      Le agradecíamos a la Razón el habernos guiado tan bien. Mas no podíamos arribar
      a esa ribera. Tal vez nos aferrábamos demasiado a la razón; en esta última etapa
      de nuestro viaje no queríamos perder nuestro sostén.\nEra natural, pero razonemos
      un poco al respecto. ¿No habíamos sido llevados, sin saberlo, al punto en que
      nos encontrábamos, a causa de una cierta fe? ¿No era la seguridad de nuestro
      razonamiento la que nos impulsaba a creer? ¿No era la nuestra una especie de
      fe?\nSí, nosotros habíamos creído, y creído de una manera servil, en el Dios
      de la Razón. ¡Así habíamos descubierto que, de un modo u otro, se trataba de
      fe!\nHabíamos descubierto de manera simultánea que éramos adoradores. ¡Cuántas
      veces el solo hecho de pronunciar esta palabra hacía que a nosotros los intelectuales
      se nos pusiese la piel de gallina! ¿No habíamos adorado, de diversos modos,
      a las personas, los sentimientos, las cosas, el dinero y a nosotros mismos?
      ¿Y después, con motivos seguramente más nobles, no habíamos visto con adoración
      la puesta del sol, el mar o simplemente una flor? ¿Y cuántos de estos sentimientos,
      de estos amores, de estas formas de adoración, tenían que ver con la pura razón?
      ¿Quién de nosotros no había amado algo o a alguien? ¿No constituía todo eso
      la materia de que estaba hecha nuestra vida? ¿No eran adecuados estos sentimientos
      para determinar el curso de nuestra existencia? Era imposible afirmar que nosotros
      no tuvimos la capacidad de creer, de amar o de adorar. Habíamos vivido, de cualquier
      modo, de una fe o por una fe.\n¡Imagínese una vida sin fe! Si nos hubiese dado
      sólo la razón, ¡qué cosa sería la vida ! Pero creíamos en la vida, evidentemente
      que creíamos. Ciertamente no podíamos dar una prueba de la vida, tal como se
      demuestra que la línea recta es la distancia más corta entre dos puntos, pero
      ahí estaba la vida. ¿Podíamos decir otra vez que todo eso no era mas que una
      masa de electrones creados de la nada, sin ningún significado y en rotación
      hacia un destino ignoto surgido de la nada? Evidentemente que no. Los mismos
      electrones parecían más inteligentes que esto. Así lo afirman los mismos químicos.\nEntonces
      vimos que la razón no era todo. Tal como la utilizamos, tampoco es enteramente
      confiable, aun cuando emane de los cerebros más brillantes. Pensamos en aquéllos
      que habían demostrado que el hombre jamás volaría por los aires.\nHabíamos asistido,
      en una u otra forma de vuelo, a la liberación del espíritu humano; habíamos
      visto a personas que se elevaban sobre sus propios problemas. Esto era gracias
      a Dios — decían ellos — y nosotros sólo nos limitábamos a sonreír. Habíamos
      sido los testigos de una liberación espiritual, pero preferíamos decir que no
      era verdad.\nNos engañábamos recíprocamente en aquel tiempo, porque en cada
      hombre, mujer y niño está profundamente arraigada la idea de Dios. Ésta puede
      estar enmascarada por la desdicha, la vanidad, el culto a otros valores; pero
      la idea de Dios está ahí; en cualquier forma, siempre está ahí. La fe en un
      Poder Superior a nosotros mismos y las manifestaciones milagrosas de esta fuerza
      en la vida de los seres humanos son hechos tan antiguos como el hombre mismo.\nFinalmente,
      descubrimos que la fe en Dios, sin importar de qué tipo de dios se hable, era
      parte de nuestra naturaleza, como los sentimientos que experimentamos por un
      amigo. A veces debimos buscar mucho, pero Él estaba ahí. Su existencia era tan
      real como la nuestra. Descubrimos la Gran Realidad dentro de nuestra alma. En
      el último análisis es solamente ahí donde se le puede encontrar. Así nos ocurrió
      a nosotros.\nTodo lo que nosotros podemos hacer es despejar un poco el camino
      para los demás. Si nuestro testimonio le ayuda a librarse de sus prejuicios,
      lo hace capaz de reflexionar honestamente, lo anima a buscar diligentemente
      dentro de usted, entonces, si quiere, puede unirse a nosotros en el Gran Camino.
      Si usted está dispuesto hasta este punto, no podrá fallar. Necesariamente tomará
      conciencia de su propia fe.\nEncontrará en este libro la historia de un hombre
      que se creía ateo. Su testimonio es tan interesante que queremos anticipar algo
      aquí. Su metamorfosis interior fue espectacular, emotiva y convincente.\nNuestro
      amigo era hijo de un ministro protestante. Frecuentó la escuela religiosa, donde
      se rebeló contra todo aquello que le parecía excesivo en la enseñanza religiosa.
      En los años siguientes se sintió perseguido por un sentimiento de desorden y
      frustración. Fracasos en los negocios, locura, enfermedad fatal, suicidio, todas
      las desgracias que atormentaron a su familia inmediata lo dejaron deprimido
      y amargado. Las desilusiones de los años de posguerra, el agravamiento de su
      alcoholismo y la amenaza de la ruina mental y física llevaron a este hombre
      a la orilla del suicidio.\nUna noche, en el cuarto de un hospital, le habló
      un alcohólico que había vivido una experiencia espiritual. Nuestro amigo se
      puso a gritar con rencor : „Si hay un Dios, ciertamente que no ha hecho nada
      por mí”. Más tarde, a solas en su cuarto, se preguntó: „¿Podrán todos los creyentes
      estar equivocados ?” Al reflexionar en esta pregunta vivió las torturas del
      infierno. Después, súbitamente, como un pensamiento fulminante, le llegó la
      idea que se formuló así: „ ¿QUIEN ERES TU PARA AFIRMAR QUE DIOS NO EXISTE?”\nEste
      hombre nos cuenta que cayó de rodillas junto a su lecho. En pocos segundos fue
      dominado por la convicción de que Dios estaba presente. Esta certeza se acercó
      a él y lo penetró con la seguridad y la solemnidad de una gran marea. Las barreras
      que había erigido por años y años se desplomaron. Se encontraba en presencia
      del Poder y el Amor infinitos. Del puente había pasado a la playa. Por vez primera
      vivía en la consciente compañía de su Creador.\nAsí se puso en su lugar la piedra
      angular de la vida de nuestro amigo. Después, ninguna vicisitud lo llegó a inquietar
      en su vida. El problema de alcoholismo de este hombre fue eliminado. Esa misma
      noche, el alcohol llegó a ser cosa del pasado. Salvo en algunas ocasiones, la
      idea de beber no regresó jamás a nuestro amigo; y todavía más, le tomó una gran
      aversión a ella. Aparentemente, aunque él hubiese querido beber, no habría podido.
      Dios le había restituido la razón.\n¿No es una curación milagrosa? Sin embargo,
      los elementos de que consta son simples. Este hombre se dispuso a tener fe,
      debido a las circunstancias. Él se ofreció humildemente al Autor de sus días
      — fue entonces cuando lo supo.\nTambién nosotros recuperamos la razón por la
      gracia de Dios. Para este hombre, la revelación fue repentina. Para otros, el
      cambio ha sido más lento. Sin embargo, Él ha venido a todos aquellos que lo
      han buscado con honestidad.\nCuando nos acercamos a Él, !Él se nos reveló!\n"

    - NUESTRO PROGRAMA
    - "Raramente hemos visto a una persona que, siguiendo el camino recorrido por
      nosotros, no haya tenido éxito en su lucha contra el alcohol. Los que no se
      restablecen son personas que no pueden o no quieren someterse completamente
      a este simple programa. Son por lo común hombres y mujeres que por naturaleza
      son incapaces de ser sinceros consigo mismos. Hay esta clase de desafortunados.
      No es su culpa, parecen haber nacido así. Su naturaleza no les permite adoptar
      y desarrollar una forma de vivir que exige una rigurosa honestidad. Sus posibilidades
      de restablecerse son limitadas. Aunque son individuos que sufren graves anomalías
      emocionales y mentales; sin embargo, muchos de ellos se restablecen si son capaces
      de ser honestos y sinceros.\nNuestras historias revelan lo que éramos, lo que
      nos sucedió y lo que ahora somos. Si usted, lector, quiere lo que nosotros\n￼\ntenemos
      y está dispuesto a todo para obtener nuestros resultados, estará dispuesto a
      avanzar por pasos.\nAl principio, algunos de estos pasos no fueron aceptados
      por nosotros. Pensábamos poder encontrar un camino más fácil, más cómodo. Mas
      esto fue imposible. Con toda la energía y honestidad que poseemos, le rogamos
      no tener miedo y ser sincero desde el comienzo. Varios de nosotros han intentado
      aferrarse a sus viejas ideas y el resultado ha sido cero hasta que las abandonan.\nRecordemos
      todos que tenemos que tratar con el alcohol — ¡astuto, desconcertante y potente!
      Sin ayuda, es demasiado para nosotros. Pero hay un Ser que tiene todo el poder,
      y este Ser es Dios. ¡Te deseamos que lo encuentres ahora!\nLas medidas parciales
      no nos ayudaron. Estuvimos en el punto decisivo de nuestra vida. Pedimos ayuda
      y protección a Dios, abandonándonos completamente a Su voluntad.\nHe aquí los
      pasos que seguimos y que proponemos como programa de recuperación:\n.1)  Admitimos
      nuestra impotencia ante el alcohol y que nuestras vidas se habían vuelto incontrolables.
      \n.2)  Llegamos a creer que un Poder más grande que nosotros podría devolvernos
      la razn. \n.3)  Tomamos la decisión de confiar nuestra voluntad y nuestras vidas
      al cuidado de Dios, tal como lo pudimos concebir. \n.4)  Procedimos a hacer
      un inventario moral profundo y sin miedo de nosotros mismos. \n.5)  AdmitimosfrenteaDios,frenteanosotrosmismosyfrente
      a otro ser humano, la naturaleza exacta de nuestras culpas. \n.6)  Consentimos
      plenamente que Dios eliminase todos los \Ldefectos de nuestro carácter. \n.7)
       Nosotros Le pedimos humildemente que hiciese \ndesaparecer nuestras deficiencias.\n￼\n.8)
       Hicimosunalistadetodaslaspersonasalasquehabíamos dañado y decidimos hacer enmiendas
      a todas ellas. \n.9)  Hicimos enmiendas directamente a tales personas, en cuanto
      nos fue posible, excluyendo aquellos casos en que, al hacerlo, hubiéramos podido
      dañarlas a ellas o a otras personas. \n.10)  Continuamos haciendo nuestro inventario
      personal y cuando nos encontrábamos en culpa, de inmediato lo admitimos. \n.11)
       Buscamos,atravésdelaoraciónylameditación,mejorar nuestro contactonsciente con
      Dios, como nosotros pudimos concebirlo, rogando sólo que nos hiciera conocer
      Su voluntad con respecto a nosotros y que nos diera la fuerza para cumplirla.
      \n.12)  Habiendo conocido una experiencia espiritual como resultado de estos
      pasos, tratamos entonces de transmitir este mensaje a otros alcohólicos y de
      poner en práctica estos principios en todos los actos de nuestra vida. \LMuchos
      de nosotros exclamaron: „¡Es demasiado difícil! \n¡Yo no voy a llegar!” No se
      desanime. Nadie de nosotros ha podido poner en práctica estos principios a la
      perfección. No somos santos. Lo que cuenta es que nosotros estemos dispuestos
      a progresar según los principios espirituales. Nosotros hemos buscado progreso
      espiritual mas que perfección espiritual.\nNuestra descripción del alcohólico,
      el capítulo que dedicamos a los agnósticos, nuestras experiencias antes y después
      de la recuperación, ponen en evidencia tres puntos bastante claros :\n.a)  Que
      éramos alcohólicos e incapaces de controlar as vidas. \n.b)  Que probablemente
      ninguna fuerza humana hubiese podido salvarnos del alcoholismo. \n.c)  Que Dios
      podía y quería hacerlo si Lo buscábamos. \n￼\nFinalmente convencidos, estábamos
      en el Tercer Paso, que habla de todo lo que es necesario para el abandono de
      nuestra voluntad y nuestra vida al cuidado de Dios. ¿Qué tratamos de decir con
      esto ? ¿Y que hacemos exactamente para abandonarnos a Él ?\nEl primer requisito
      es el convencimiento de que una vida conducida de acuerdo con la propia voluntad
      e independencia raramente puede tener éxito. Sobre esta base casi siempre nos
      encontramos en conflicto con alguien o algo, aunque nuestros motivos sean buenos.
      La mayor parte de los hombres trata de vivir basándose en su propia energía
      personal. Cada persona es como un actor que pretende dirigir la representación
      total: las luces, la danza, los actores, el escenario, siguiendo sus propios
      gustos. Si sus órdenes se siguieran y si los otros sólo se apegaran a sus deseos,
      el espectáculo serí perfecto. Todos estarían satisfechos, incluso él. La vida
      sería magnífica. En sus esfuerzos por poner todo en orden, nuestro actor quizá
      pueda mostrarse a veces muy virtuoso. Puede ser afable, simpático, cortés, generoso,
      indulgente, modesto y altruista. Y también puede ser egoísta, deshonesto y agresivo.
      Como todas las personas en este mundo, es probable que tenga una personalidad
      con múltiples facetas.\n¿Qué ocurre normalmente? El espectáculo no se desarrolla
      muy bien y nuestro actor comienza a creer que el ambiente en el que vive no
      lo trata como él piensa que se merece. Decide hacer esfuerzos más grandes para
      tener éxito. Se vuelve más exigente o más amable, según sea el caso. No obstante,
      el espectáculo ahora no le gusta. Admite que tal vez tiene alguna culpa, pero
      piensa que los demás son más culpables. Se irrita, se indigna y se desprecia.
      ¿Cuál es su problema fundamental? ¿No es verdad que trata de alabarse a sí mismo,
      aun cuando trata de ser gentil? ¿No es víctima de la ilusión de que se puede
      lograr dicha y satisfacción en este mundo con la sola condición de saber cómo
      hacerlo? ¿No es evidente para el resto de los actores que esto es lo que él
      quiere? ¿Y no es cierto que todo eso incita a los otros a vengarse, retirando
      lo mejor del espectáculo? Aun en sus mejores momentos, ¿no crea él más confusión
      que armonía?\nNuestro actor es un egocéntrico y un ególatra. Es como un rico
      pensionado que pasa bien el invierno bajo el sol de Florida, lamentando el desastre
      financiero en el que se encuentra su nación; es como un predicador que suspira
      con horror por los pecados del siglo XX; es como el político y el reformador
      que afirma que seguramente la Utopía se realizaría si los demás se comportaran
      bien; y como el ladrón que fuerza cajas de valores mientras piensa que la sociedad
      se ha comportado mal con él; y como el alcohólico que ha perdido todo y se recupera
      tras de cuatro paredes. Cualesquiera que sean nuestras protestas, ¿no es verdad
      que la mayor parte de nosotros estamos preocupados por nosotros mismos, por
      los propios resentimientos, y no hacemos más que conmiserarnos?\nEgoísmo y egocentrismo.
      He aquí la causa de nuestras penas. Llevados por múltiples formas de temor,
      miedo, preocupaciones, autoconmiseración, pisamos a los otros y ellos reaccionan.
      A veces nos hacen daño, sin que haya mediado una provocación de nuestra parte;
      pero si reflexionamos sobre cuánto hemos hecho, podremos reconocer que dimos
      motivos suficientes para provocarlos, porque bajo nuestro egocentrismo y nuestra
      autoconmiseración no pensamos mas que en nosotros, sin preocuparnos de los demás.\nEn
      el fondo pensamos que la causa de nuestros problemas somos nosotros mismos.
      Ellos surgen de nuestro interior. Y el alcohólico es el ejemplo típico de una
      voluntad sin freno, aunque la mayor parte de las veces no se dé cuenta. Antes
      que todo, los alcohólicos debemos desembarazarnos de nuestro egoísmo, si no
      el egoísmo nos mata. Dios nos da la posibilidad. A menudo la experiencia nos
      enseña que no nos es posible abandonar nuestro egoísmo sin Su ayuda. Muchos
      de nosotros tuvimos muchas convicciones morales y filosóficas, pero no pudimos
      ponerlas en práctica aun cuando lo deseábamos. Ni tampoco pudimos con nuestra
      solas fuerzas reducir nuestro egoísmo, por mucho que deseáramos o tratáramos.
      Necesitamos la ayuda de Dios.\nHe aquí el cómo y el porqué de nuestro método.
      Antes que nada tuvimos que dejar de comportarnos como si fuésemos Dios. Este
      modo de ser no funcionó. Después decidimos que en este drama de la vida Dios
      fuese nuestro Director: ¡Él sería el Director y nosotros sus agentes! Él es
      el Padre y nosotros somos Sus hijos. La mayor parte de las buenas ideas no son
      complicadas, sino simples, y este concepto ha sido la llave de este arco del
      triunfo por el cual hemos pasado para reencontrar nuestra libertad.\nTomada
      esta resolución con sinceridad, comprendimos que en torno nuestro acaecían cosas
      maravillosas y que teníamos un nuevo Patrón. En Su omnipotencia, Él nos proveía
      de lo que necesitásemos, a condición de que estuviéramos cerca de Él e hiciésemos
      bien Su trabajo. Llenos de fe en Él, nos fuimos interesando menos en nosotros
      mismos, en nuestras pequeñas ideas y en nuestros proyectos. Más y más interesante
      era aportar una contribución a la vida. Mientras sentíamos que nos inundaba
      una nueva fuerza, gozábamos una profunda paz del espíritu y cuando descubrimos
      la posibilidad de encarar la vida con éxito, cuando tuvimos conciencia de Su
      presencia, comenzamos a perder aquel miedo del hoy, del mañana y del porvenir
      que siempre habíamos tenido. Habíamos nacido por segunda vez.\nAquí nos encontramos
      entonces en el Tercer Paso. Varios de nosotros se dirigieron a su Creador, tal
      como ellos lo entendían, con la siguiente plegaria: Oh, Dios, te ofrezco todo
      de mí para que Tú puedas rehacerme de nuevo y hagas de mí lo que quieras. Libérame
      de la esclavitud del egoísmo, para que yo pueda cumplir tu Voluntad. Aleja de
      mí las dificultades, de suerte que mi victoria sobre ellas sea un testimonio
      de Tu fuerza, de Tu amor y de Tu modo de vida para aquéllos a quienes yo haya
      ayudado. Haz que yo pueda hacer siempre Tu voluntad.” Largamente reflexionamos
      antes de pasar esta etapa, ya que queríamos estar bien dispuestos; queríamos
      estar seguros de que, al fin, podíamos abandonarnos a Él completamente.\nDescubrimos
      que era bueno afrontar este paso de crecimiento espiritual junto con alguna
      persona comprensiva, ya fuera la esposa o un buen amigo o el director espiritual.
      Mejor es encontrarse a solas con Dios que con una persona que no comprenda.
      La selección de las palabras evidentemente que depende de nosotros: lo importante
      es que se exprese claramente lo que uno intente afirmar. Es solamente el inicio,
      pero si se comienza con humildad y honestidad el camino hacia el abandono a
      Dios, de inmediato se tienen resultados, a veces bastante grandes.\nEnseguida
      nos encaminamos en una carrera de vigorosa actividad, cuyo primer paso es un
      inventario personal, una limpieza de nuestra conciencia, que muchos de nosotros
      ni siquiera habían intentado hacer. Aunque la decisión tomada fue crucial y
      determinante, comprendimos que no podía haber un efecto duradero si no era seguida
      por un constante y continuo acto de voluntad de enfrentar y liberarnos de todos
      nuestros impedimentos. La necesidad de beber no era más que un síntoma. Por
      lo tanto, debíamos atacar las causas y los motivos.\nPara tal fin, como dijimos
      arriba, comenzamos el inventario personal. Era el Cuarto Paso de nuestro crecimiento
      espiritual. Un negociante que no hace regularmente el inventario de las mercancías,
      está destinado al fracaso. Hacer un inventario comercial consiste en reconocer
      los hechos y examinarlos. Se busca conocer bien las mercancías en almacén. Uno
      de los fines de la operación es determinar cuáles son las mercancías dañadas
      o invendibles. Entonces hay que liberarse de ellas prontamente y sin lamentarlo.
      Si un negociante está interesado en el éxito, no puede engañarse sobre cuánto
      hay en la tienda.\nHicimos un inventario semejante de nuestra vida, y lo hicimos
      sinceramente. Al principio buscamos las imperfecciones de nuestro carácter que
      causaron nuestro fracaso. Convencidos de que el egoísmo es la causa de nuestra
      ruina, consideramos sus manifestaciones más comunes.\nEl resentimiento es el
      enemigo „número uno”. Este sentimiento destruye más alcohólicos que cualquier
      otra cosa. Da lugar a todas las formas de enfermedad espiritual; hay que admitir
      que estábamos afectados no sólo mentalmente y físicamente, sino también espiritualmente.
      Por lo tanto, cuando el mal espiritual ya no existe, nos recuperamos física
      y mentalmente. Para examinar nuestros resentimientos, los escribimos sobre una
      hoja. Hicimos la lista de las personas, de las instituciones o de los principios
      que suscitaban nuestra cólera. Nos preguntamos por qué nos enojábamos. Encontramos
      que la mayor parte del tiempo nos sentimos heridos o amenazados en nuestro amor
      propio; nuestras ambiciones, nuestra cartera, nuestras relaciones personales
      (comprendidas aquí las sexuales) estaban en peligro y amenazadas. Eso nos hacía
      sufrir y también encolerizarnos.\nEn la lista de nuestros resentimientos también
      apuntamos, al lado de cada nombre, la naturaleza de nuestra herida, preguntándonos
      qué aspecto de nuestra vida había sido afectado: ¿nuestro amor propio, nuestra
      seguridad, nuestras ambiciones, nuestras relaciones personales, nuestras relaciones
      sexuales?\nEn general, nuestra descripción era tan precisa como la siguiente:\nTengo
      resenti- miento hacia\nSr. Guzmán.\nCausa\nSus atenciones para con mi mujer.\nLe
      dijo a mi mujer que tengo una amante.\LGuzmán podría tomar mi puesto en la oficina.\nEs
      una loca; me rechazó. internó a su marido por beber. Él es mi amigo. Ella es
      una chismosa. Irrazonable — Injusto\n- Exige demasiado\L- Amenaza con correrme

      Castañón.\nMi patrón.\nMi mujer.\nAsí, hicimos una revisión de nuestras vidas,
      con la máxima exactitud y honestidad. Al terminar nuestra tarea estudiamos con
      cuidado lo que habíamos descubierto. La cosa más evidente fue que este mundo
      y quienes lo habitan están llenos de errores y de defectos. Una buena parte
      de nosotros llegó a la conclusión de que eran los otros quienes estaban equivocados.
      Resultaba, naturalmente, que ellos continuaban causándonos mal y que nosotros
      continuábamos conmiserándonos. Luego de los remordimientos seguía la autoconmiseración.
      Pero entre más luchábamos y más tratábamos de arreglar las cosas según nuestro
      punto de vista, más se embrollaba la sit Como en la guerra, nuestra victoria
      era sólo aparente. Nuestros momentos de triunfo tenían una escasa duración.\nUna
      cosa es clara : aquél que viva en el resentimiento profundo, acaba por llevar
      una existencia fútil y desdichada. Y cuando dábamos desahogo a nuestro resentimiento,
      desperdiciábamos minutos preciosos. Mas para el alcohólico, cuya esperanza es
      conservar y mejorar una experiencia espiritual, este rencor — el resentimiento
      — es extremadamente grave. Encontramos que es fatal. Cuando alimentamos ciertos
      sentimientos, impedimos que los rayos del Espíritu toquen nuestro espíritu.
      Regresa la locura del alcohol y volvemos a beber. Y, para nosotros, beber equivale
      a morir.\nSi queremos vivir, es necesario liberarnos de la cólera. No va bien
      con nosotros la impaciencia, ni los excesos mentales y pasionales. Quien es
      normal puede permitirse estos lujos, pero, para el alcohólico, tales estados
      de ánimo son veneno.\nRegresamos a la lista que habíamos hecho, ya que, según
      nosotros, contenía le del porvenir. Estuvimos dispuestos a examinar esta llave
      desde un punto de vista completamente nuevo. Entonces comenzamos a comprender
      que el mundo y sus habitantes en verdad nos dominaban. Siendo así las cosas,
      las acciones de otros, reales o hipotéticas, tenían el poder para matarnos.
      ¿Cómo podíamos escapar de esta suerte? Comprendimos que debíamos dominar los
      resentimientos, pero ¿cómo? No teníamos mayor control sobre nuestros resentimientos,
      igual que nos ocurría con el alcohol.\nEste fue nuestro modo de proceder: nos
      dimos cuenta de que las personas que nos infligían males estaban espiritualmente
      enfermas, como lo estábamos nosotros. Pedimos a Dios que nos diera el espíritu
      de tolerancia, de benevolencia y de paciencia que hubiésemos mostrado con un
      amigo que estuviese enfermo.\nCuando alguien nos ofendía con su comportamiento,
      nos decíamos a nosotros mismos: „Es una persona enferma. ¿Cómo podré serle útil?
      ¡Que Dios me preserve de la cólera! ¡Que Tu voluntad se cumpla, oh Seño!”\nEvitamos
      la venganza o las discusiones. Con las personas enfermas no nos comportaríamos
      así. Si lo hiciéramos, destruiríamos toda buena esperanza de ayudar a los demás.
      No podíamos ser útiles a todos, pero Dios nos mostraría cómo tratar a todos
      y a cada uno con dulzura y tolerancia.\nVolvamos a nuestra lista. Enfrentamos
      resueltamente nuestros errores, poniendo completamente aparte los males que
      otros nos habían hecho a nosotros. ¿Cuándo habíamos sido nosotros los egoístas,
      los deshonestos, los miedosos? Aunque no hubiéramos sido del todo responsables
      de una cierta situación, tratamos de olvidar el papel hecho por las otras personas.
      ¿Cuándo habíamos sido nosotros los culpables? Hicimos el inventario de nuestro
      comportamiento, no el de los demás. Una vez descubiertos nuestros errores, los
      pusimos en una lista. En blanco y negro estaban ante nuestros ojos. Admitimos
      honestamente nuestros errores y expresamos la voluntad de corregirlos.\nSi se
      observa el ejemplo descrito arriba, se notará que la palabra „miedo” está escrita
      entre paréntesis cuando se trata de las dificultades relacionadas con el señor
      Guzmán, la señora Castañón, el patrón y la esposa. Esta palabra, así de corta,
      tiene que ver con todos los aspectos de nuestra vida. El tejido de nuestra existencia
      fue corroído por este hilo temible y diabólico; puso en movimiento tantas circunstancias
      que nos trajeron desgracias, que pensamos que no merecíamos. Pero, ¿acaso no
      éramos nosotros los que habíamos dado la patada inicial? Hemos llegado a pensar
      a veces que el miedo puede ser clasificado como el robo, en cuanto causa y multiplica
      los problemas.\nExaminamos con toda precisión nuestros miedos. Los catalogamos
      por escrito, aunque no hubiesen estado acompañados de resentimiento. Nos interrogamos
      sobre su causa. ¿No era que nuestras fuerzas nos habían fallado? La confianza
      en nosotros era buena, pero no pudo llegar lo suficientemente lejos. Ni el problema
      del miedo, ni ninguno de los otros problemas que padecíamos, pudo ser vencido
      con la confianza en nosotros mismos. Es más, cuando esta virtud nos hacía sentirnos
      orgullosos, todo empeoraba.\n¿Existe un método mejor? Así lo creemos, pues ahora
      tenemos otros fundamentos: la confianza en Dios y el abandono a Sus cuidados.
      Más que fiarnos de nuestro yo limitado, ponemos nuestra confianza en un Dios
      infinito. Estamos en el mundo para desempeñar el papel que Él nos asignó. En
      la medida en que hagamos lo que creamos que El quiere y humildemente dependamos
      de Él, nos capacitará para enfrentar con serenidad la desgracia.\nJamás nos
      excusamos ante nadie por depender de nuestro Creador. Podemos reírnos de aquéllos
      que consideran la espiritualidad como la vía de la debilidad. Al contrario,
      es la vía de la fuerza. La historia ha demostrado que fe es sinónimo de coraje.
      Todos los hombres de fe han tenido coraje. Tienen confianza en su Dios. En ningún
      caso nos excusamos a causa de Dios. Nosotros mejor Le dejamos demostrar, a través
      de nosotros, lo que Él puede hacer. Nosotros Le pedimos que nos libere de nuestro
      miedo y que nos haga ver lo que quiere de nosotros. A partir de ahí sentimos
      al temor alejarse de nosotros.\nLlegamos ahora a la cuestión sexual. Varios
      de nosotros tuvieron necesidad de una reforma en ese campo. Pero, antes que
      todo, tratamos de ser sensibles al respecto, ya que es muy fácil extraviarse.
      Es un punto sobre el cual las opiniones son diametralmente opuestas, y van también
      hasta extremos absurdos. Por una parte, están aquéllos para quienes las relaciones
      sexuales no hacen más que satisfacer las necesidades de nuestra naturaleza interior
      y no responden exclusivamente más que a la sola necesidad de procrear. Por otra
      parte, están aquéllos que siempre demandan más y más sexo, y que deploran la
      institución del matrimonio. Ellos consideran que la mayoría de los problemas
      del género humano son, en el fondo, problemas de orden sexual. Para ellos, o
      nuestras relaciones sexuales no son lo suficientemente frecuentes o no son buenas.
      Todo les parece revelar la vida sexual. Para algunos, la pimienta de la vida
      debería prohibirse; para otros, sólo la pimienta debería contar. No queremos
      entrar en esta controversia. No queremos ser los árbitros de ninguna actitud
      frente a la sexualidad. Todos nosotros tenemos problemas de sexualidad. No seríamos
      seres humanos si no los tuviésemos. Pero ¿cómo resolverlos ?\nAnalizamos nuestra
      conducta de años pasados. ¿Cuándo habíamos sido egoístas, deshonestos o desconsiderados?
      ¿Le habíamos hecho daño a alguien? ¿Habíamos sido, sin un motivo válido, la
      causa de celos, de sospecha o de amargura para otras personas? ¿Cuándo habíamos
      actuado mal en ciertas situaciones? ¿Cómo debimos habernos comportado? Transcribimos
      todo, lo clasificamos y nos pusimos a estudiar el resultado.\nAl estudiar nuestra
      conducta, intentamos trazarnos para el futuro un ideal de vida sexual que fuese
      sano y realista. Para cada relación nos hicimos la siguiente pregunta: ¿Habíamos
      sido o no egoístas? Le pedimos a Dios que nos ayudara a moldear un ideal y a
      actuar de acuerdo con el mismo. Siempre llevábamos en la mente que nuestra facultades
      sexuales nos habían sido dadas por Dios y que, por consiguiente, no podían ser
      malas; pero que no podíamos utilizarlas a la ligera o egoístamente, ni tampoco
      debíamos despreciarlas o tenerles aversión.\nCualquiera que sea el ideal adoptado,
      debemos siempre estar dispuestos a crecer hacia el mismo. Debemos estar dispuestos
      a hacer enmiendas por los daños que hayamos causado, siempre que esta reparación
      no cause daños aun más grandes. En otras palabras, tratamos la cuestión sexual
      como todas las demás. En nuestra meditación le pedimos a Dios lo que debemos
      hacer ante cada situación examinada. La buena respuesta nos será dada si nosotros
      lo deseamos.\nSólo Dios puede ser el juez imparcial de nuestra situación en
      materia sexual. A menudo es útil consultar con otras personas, pero nosotros
      dejamos a Dios el juicio final. Nos damos cuenta de que, cuando se trata de
      cuestiones sexuales, podemos encontrar a personas demasiado rigurosas o demasiado
      indulgentes. Evitamos las ideas o el consejo de personas histéricas.\nSupongamos
      que no alcancemos a llegar a la meta ideal que nos fijamos. ¿Vamos a beber,
      por lo tanto? Hay quienes comparten esta opinión. Pero esto no es más que una
      verdad a medias. Todo depende de nosotros y de nuestros motivos. Si lamentamos
      nuestro error y tenemos el deseo sincero de dejar que Dios nos guíe hacia lo
      que sea mejor, creemos que seremos perdonados y que habremos aprendidonuestra
      lección. Si no nos arrepentimos de nuestra conducta pasada y seguimos tranquilamente
      haciendo el mal a los demás, es verdad que volveremos a beber. Esta no es una
      teoría. Son hechos aprendidos con nuestra experiencia.\nPara regresar de manera
      sucinta al problema del sexo, sinceramente rezamos para conocer nuestro comportamiento
      ideal en este terreno, para obtener ayuda en situaciones dudosas, el sentido
      común y la fuerza para hacer lo que esté bien. Si nuestra vida sexual nos causa
      graves penas, nos ponemos una vez más a servirle a otros. Pensamos en sus necesidades
      y tratamos de ayudarlos para que las satisfagan. Eso nos obliga a salir de nosotros
      mismos. Nos calma los deseos imperiosos, cuya satisfacción significaría sufrimiento.\nSi
      verdaderamente hemos hecho un inventario exhaustivo, escribimos mucho. Enumeramos
      y analizamos nuestros resentimientos. Empezamos a comprender su futilidad y
      el peligro mortal que representaban. Comenzamos a ver lo terriblemente destructores
      que son. Comenzamos a aprender lo que son la tolerancia, la paciencia y la buena
      voluntad hacia nuestros semejantes y también hacia nuestros enemigos, a los
      que empezamos a ver como seres enfermos. Hicimos la lista de las personas que
      nuestra conducta había lastimado y estuvimos dispuestos a reparar, si era posible,
      el daño que les habíamos causado en el pasado.\nEn este libro ha leído usted
      una y otra vez que la fe ha hecho por nosotros lo que no pudimos hacer por nosotros
      mismos. Esperamos haberlo convencido de que Dios puede liberarnos de toda forma
      de voluntad personal, de eso que nos apartaba de Él. Si usted ya ha tomado una
      decisión en lo que a Él concierne y ya ha hecho un inventario de sus debilidades
      más graves, ha tenido un buen comienzo. Así, ha absorbido y digerido algunas
      grandes verdades sobre usted mismo.\n"

    - |
      Después de haber hecho nuestro inventario personal, ¿qué vamos a hacer con lo que descubrimos? Intentamos encontrar una nueva actitud hacia Dios, un nuevo tipo de relación con nuestro Creador, y nos pusimos a descubrir los obstáculos a lo largo de nuestro camino. Admitimos ciertos defectos; distinguimos, de manera general, los límites del problema; gracias a nuestro inventario personal, identificamos nuestros puntos débiles. Estamos ahora a punto de ser liberados de ellos. Algo que requiere acción de nuestra parte; acción que consiste en admitir ante Dios, ante nosotros mismos y ante otro ser humano la naturaleza exacta de nuestros defectos. Y este es el Quinto Paso del programa de recuperación indicado en el capítulo precedente.
      Este paso puede ser difícil, particularmente cuando se trata de platicar con alguna otra persona sobre nuestros defectos. Se podría creer que si uno mismo los admite es más que suficiente. Sin embargo, tenemos dudas al respecto. En la práctica, encontramos generalmente que no es suficiente sólo evaluarnos. Muchos han creído necesario ir más lejos. Aceptamos más fácilmente hablar de nosotros mismos con otra persona, si vemos que hay buenas razones para hacerlo. La primera razón es la mejor: Si evadimos esta etapa vital, ya no podríamos jamás superar nuestro problema de alcohol. ¡Cuántas veces los nuevos han intentado esconder ciertos hechos de su vida! Al tratar de evitar esta humillante prueba, han recurrido a métodos más fáciles y, casi invariablemente, han bebido. Como habían seguido el resto del programa, se preguntaban la razón de que hubiesen recaído. Creemos que es porque no habían terminado su limpieza interior personal. Habían pasado bien su vida en retrospectiva, pero habían omitido los puntos más graves. Ellos solamente pensaron haber perdido su egoísmo y su miedo, solamente pensaron que eran humildes. Mas no habían aprendido lo suficiente de la humildad, del coraje y de la honestidad, en la medida que habíamos encontrado necesaria, hastas personas que en el fondo nos podían comprender y no quisimos ser honestos con ningún otro. No es de extrañarse que muchos médicos tengan una mala opinión de los alcohólicos ¡y que duden que alguna vez se recuperen!
      Debemos ser perfectamente honestos con alguien si es que queremos vivir mucho tiempo en este mundo. Con razón pensamos muy bien antes de escoger a la persona con quien hacer este paso, que es de naturaleza íntima y confidencial. Aquellos cuya religión les pide una confesión, deben, y es evidentemente deseable, confiarse a la persona que esté autorizada a recibir esa información y confidencias. Aunque no practiquemos ninguna religión, pensamos que es oportuno hablar de estas cosas con una persona que tenga autoridad en el campo religioso. Constatamos a menudo que estas personas comprenden rápidamente nuestros problemas. Pero, naturalmente, algunas veces encontramos personas que no comprenden a los alcohólicos.
      Si no queremos actuar de esta manera, nos acercamos a las personas que sí conocen, alguien discreto y comprensivo. Puede darse el caso que nuestro médico o psicólogo sea la persona más indicada. Podría ser también alguien de nuestra familia, pero estemos atentos de no revelar a nuestra esposa o a nuestros padres algo que pudiese herirlos o hacerles daño. No tenemos el derecho de salvar nuestra piel con la piel de otra persona. Contaremos nuestra historia a quien esté en ánimo de escucharla y no se escandalizará. La regla es que debemos ser inflexibles con nosotros mismos y considerados con los demás.
      No obstante la absoluta necesidad de hablar de nosotros mismos con alguien, podría darse el caso que no tuviéramos éxito en encontrar a alguien a quien contarle nuestra historia. Si las cosas están así, este paso del programa puede ser aplazado, pero solamente si estamos dispuesto a hacer estas confidencias en la primera ocasión propicia. Lo decimos porque es necesario hablar con la persona que nos parezca digna de recibir nuestras confidencias. Es importante que esta persona esté dispuesta a custodiar un secreto; que ella pueda comprender plenamente y aprobar lo que nosotros intentamos hacer; que ella no intente cambiar nuestros planes. Ésta no debe ser una excusa para retardar el encuentro con alguien.
      Cuando ya hayamos establecido quién deberá escuchar nuestra historia, no perdamos tiempo. Tenemos un inventario escrito y estamos dispuestos a hablar largamente. Explicamos a nuestro amigo lo que vamos a hacer y por qué debemos hacerlo. Deberá comprender que para nosotros se trata de una cuestión de vida o muerte. La mayor parte de las personas a las cuales nos confiamos estarán felices de ayudarnos; muchos se sentirán honrados de recibir nuestras confidencias.
      Olvidando nuestro orgullo, le iremos explicando todo, iluminando cada torcimiento de nuestro carácter, todo ángulo oscuro de nuestro pasado. Una vez que hayamos actuado así, sin esconder nada, seremos más felices. Podremos mirar al mundo a la cara. Podremos finalmente estar a solas en paz y sin miedo. Nuestros temores se desprenden de nosotros. Comenzamos a sentir que nuestro Creador está cerca de nosotros. Es posible que en el pasado nosotros hayamos creído en algo o en alguien; ahora, sin embargo, vamos a comenzar a vivir una experiencia espiritual. A menudo tendremos la impresión de que el problema del alcohol ha desaparecido. Tenemos la sensación de estar finalmente sobre la Amplia Avenida, y de caminar de la mano con el Espíritu del Universo.
      Al regresar a casa buscamos un lugar tranquilo donde podamos estar en paz una hora, al menos, y repasamos cuidadosamente lo que hicimos. Agradecemos a Dios con todo el corazón, porque Lo conocemos mejor. Tomamos este libro y lo abrimos en la página donde se encuentran los Doce Pasos del programa. Leemos atentamente los primeros cinco, preguntándonos si habremos olvidado algo, porque estamos a punto de construir un arco a través del cual vamos a pasar para encontrarnos afuera totalmente libres. ¿Nuestra labor, hasta este punto, ha sido buena? ¿Las piedras de nuestra construcción están bien colocadas ? ¿Intentamos fabricar cemento sin arena?
      Si estamos satisfechos con las respuestas, leemos lo que dice el Sexto Paso. Habíamos subrayado el hecho de que la buena voluntad es indispensable. ¿Estamos ahora listos para dejar que Dios nos quite todas las cosas que habíamos reconocido como malas en nosotros? ¿Podrá Él ahora tomar todas y cada una de ellas? Si estamos todavía aferrados a alguna cosa que no queramos abandonar, le pediremos a Dios ayudarnos a dejarla.
      Cuando estemos listos Le decimos algo parecido a esto: „Mi Creador, ahora deseo que seas el Dueño de todo mi ser, bueno y malo. Te pido que me quites todo lo que impida serte útil y ser útil a mis hermanos. Concédeme la fuerza de hacer Tu voluntad a partir de ahora. Amén.” Hemos acabado de hacer el Séptimo Paso.
      Ahora teníamos necesidad de pasar nuevamente a la acción, sin la cual comprobábamos que „la fe sin obras está muerta”. Estudiamos el Octavo y el Noveno Pasos. Teníamos entre las manos una lista de todas las personas a las que habíamos ofendido y a las cuales queríamos hacerles una enmienda honorable. Hicimos esta lista sirviéndonos de nuestro inventario moral y, en esta ocasión, nos sometimos a un severo examen. Ahora vamos hacia nuestros semejantes con el fin de reparar el daño que les infligimos en el pasado. Tratamos de despejar los escombros que se acumularon a causa de nuestros esfuerzos por vivir siguiendo nuestros propios caprichos. Si no tenemos la voluntad de hacer esto, le pedimos a Dios hasta que dicha voluntad se nos presente. Recordamos que al inicio estuvimos de acuerdo en estar dispuestos a todo para lograr nuestra victoria sobre el alcohol.
      Probablemente aún tengamos dudas. Releyendo la lista de nuestros amigos de trabajo a los cuales les hemos hecho daños, probablemente nos sintamos renuentes en ir a su encuentro basándonos en un apoyo espiritual. Tranquilicémonos. Cuando se trata de ciertas personas, no tenemos necesidad — y no deberemos tnerla en ningún caso — de abordarlas insistiendo en el elemento espiritual en nuestro primer encuentro. Podríamos hacer que la persona reaccionaria con prejuicios.
      En este punto nos encontramos tratando de poner orden en nuestra vida. Pero no se trata de un fin por sí mismo. Nuestro verdadero propósito es volvernos capaces de ponernos al servicio de Dios, y de las personas que nos rodean, del mejor modo posible. No es prudente acercarnos a una persona que aún sufra por uno de nuestros errores, y decirle que nos hemos vuelto creyentes. En un encuentro de boxeo esto equivaldría a dejar el mentón al descubierto. ¿Por qué queremos hacerla de santurrones o de fanáticos? De este modo podemos perder una oportunidad de transmitir un mensaje de salvación para quien esté en desgracia. Nuestro hombre, por el contrario, estará muy impresionado si constata que nosotros queremos reparar el mal que le causamos. Estará más interesado en una demostración, de nuestra parte, de buena voluntad, que en los cientos de discursos que podamos hacerle tranquilamente sobre nuestros descubrimientos espirituales.
      Por otra parte, no usamos lo anterior como un pretexto para evadir el tema que concierne a Dios. Cuando eso sea útil, entonces estaremos dispuestos a revelarle nuestras convicciones con tacto y equilibrio. Llegamos a preguntarnos cómo abordar a la persona que habíamos detestado. Quizás los daños que nos ha hecho son más graves y numerosos que aquéllos que nosotros le hicimos, y aunque hemos tratado de abordarlo del mejor modo, todavía no estamos demasiado inclinados a admitir nuestros errores. Aun más, con una persona que no nos gusta, apretamos los dientes. Es más difícil hablarle a un enemigo que a un amigo, pero es fácil comprender los beneficios que recibimos. Lo abordamos, entonces, con el espíritu de ayuda y perdón, evitamos nuestra pasada enemistad y expresamos nuestro arrepentimiento.
      Evitamos a toda costa criticar a esta persona o discutir con ella. Simplemente le decimos que no podremos superar nuestro problema de alcohol en tanto no hayamos hecho todo lo posible para liberarnos de nuestro pasado. Estamos ahí para reparar los daños de que somos responsables, conscientes de que no podremos hacer nada de provecho hasta que hayamos limpiado el pasado. Evitamos durante este tiempo decirle a la persona lo que tiene que hacer. Sólo mencionamos nuestras faltas, jamás las de ella. Si hablamos con calma, con franqueza y sin esconder nada, los resultados serán satisfactorios.
      En nueve casos de diez sucede lo impensable. La persona que fuimos a buscar admite a su vez su culpa y las divergencias de nuestros puntos de vista, que habían durado años y años, son subsanadas en una hora. Casi siempre progresamos de modo satisfactorio. El que antes era nuestro enemigo nos felicita y nos desea buena suerte. Algunos se ofrecen a ayudarnos. Sin embargo, no nos desesperamos si alguno hace que nos saquen de su oficina. Habremos demostrado nuestra buena voluntad, habremos hecho lo que hacía falta. Pusimos una piedra sobre el pasado.
      Casi todos los alcohólicos deben dinero a alguien. No nos escondemos de nuestros acreedores. Somos honestos con el hecho de que somos alcohólicos, ellos lo saben, lo creamos o no. No tememos más decir abiertamente que somos alcohólicos ni sentimos miedo de que esta declaración nos produzca penas financieras. Si hablamos de esta manera, el acreedor más cruel alguna vez nos sorprenderá. Llegamos al mejor arreglo que pudimos con estos individuos y les decimos además que nos arrepentimos de nuestro pasado. El alcohol nos impidió pagar nuestras deudas tiempo atrás. Hay necesidad de ya no tener miedo de nuestros acreedores, poco importa en qué medida debamos comprometernos, porque estamos en peligro de retornar a la bebida si tememos enfrentarlos.
      Quizás habíamos cometido un delito que podía conducirnos a prisión si era conocido por la autoridad judicial. Pudo haberse tratado del dinero de la caja de la oficina donde estábamos trabajando y no podíamos reembolsar esos saldos. Esto ya se lo habíamos confesado en forma confidencial a otra persona, pero estábamos seguros de que llegaríamos a prisión y perderíamos nuestro puesto si era descubierto. Podría tratarse de un delito menor, como aquél de inflar nuestras notas de gastos. Así habíamos actuado casi todos. Nos divorciados y nos volvimos a casar, pero no hemos continuado proporcionando alimentos a la primera esposa. Ella está furiosa y nos ha denunciado y la policía está a punto de arrestarnos. Éste es un problema que conocemos bien.
      Aun cuando estas „reparaciones” son multiformes, hay principios generales que, descubrimos, son una buena guía. Recordando continuamente que habíamos decidido hacer todo lo posible por obtener una experiencia espiritual, pedimos la fuerza y la dirección que nos permitieran hacer nuestro deber, sin dar paso a las eventuales consecuencias en el plano personal. Podemos, sí, perder nuestra posición social, podemos perder nuestra reputación o ser amenazados de ir a prisión, pero estamos dispuestos a todo. Debemos hacerlo. No debemos retroceder ante nada.
      La mayor parte de las veces, otras personas están involucradas, y esto era el motivo por el cual no debíamos actuar demasiado de prisa. No hay necesidad de hacerla de mártir, y sacrificar sin necesidad a otras personas, para salir del pozo del alcohol. Conocemos a un hombre que se había vuelto a casar. A causa del alcohol y el resentimiento no le pagó la pensión alimentaria a su primera esposa. Ella estaba furiosa por eso. Se presentó ante el juez y obtuvo una orden de comparecencia. El hombre, en tanto, había comenzado a vivir según los principios de A.A., había obtenido un empleo y había dejado el alcohol. Hubiese sido demasiado «heroico» de su parte haber acudido ante el juez y decir: «Aquí estoy».
      Pensamos que habría debido hacer este sacrificio si hubiera sido verdaderamente necesario, pero, por otra parte, si lo hubiesen metido en la cárcel, no habría podido dar nada a ninguna de sus dos familias. Le sugerimos escribir a su primera mujer, admitir sus errores y pedirle perdón. Envió la carta junto con una pequeña suma de dinero. Le explicó también lo que tenía intención de hacer para el futuro. Agregó que estaba dispuesto a ir a la cárcel si ella insistía. Desde luego que ella renunció a sus exigencias y la situación, desde entonces, regresó a su cauce normal.
      Antes de tomar medidas radicales que pudieran comprometer a otras personas, nos aseguramos de tener el consentimiento de ellas. Después de que se nos ha otorgado el permiso, de que pedimos consejo a otras personas y de que pedimos la ayuda de Dios, si el paso a tomar es drástico, entonces no debemos retroceder.
      Esto nos recuerda la historia de uno de nuestros amigos. En la época en que bebía, aceptó una suma de dinero de un hombre de negocios al que él detestaba, sin darle ningún recibo. Enseguida negó haber recibido el dinero y se sirvió del incidente para desacreditar a aquel hombre. Se sirvió así de su deshonestidad para arruinar a otra persona. En efecto, su rival perdió toda su reputación.
      Nuestro amigo creía haber cometido una acción irreparable. Se había tratado el asunto ante un tribunal, temía arruinar la buena fama de quien laboraba con él como socio, causar la desgracia de su propia familia y perder todo aquello que le daba de vivir. ¿Tenía el derecho de involucrar a aquéllos que dependían de él? ¿Cómo podría declarar en público para exonerar a su antiguo rival?
      Después de haber consultado con su mujer y con su socio, llegó a la conclusión de que era mejor correr ese riesgo que permanecer culpable de semejante calumnia en la presencia de su Creador. Comprendió que debía poner en las manos de Dios las consecuencias de tal gesto, de otra forma seguramente habría comenzado de nuevo a beber y todo se habría perdido lamentablemente. Por vez primera en muchísimos años asistió a un servicio religioso. Después del sermón se puso de pie y con mucha calma explicó todas las cosas. Su gesto recibió la aprobación de todos y hoy es uno de los ciudadanos más respetados de su ciudad. Estos hechos ocurrieron hace muchos años.
      Muy probablemente tenemos problemas de familia. Nos comportamos con las mujeres quizás en una forma tal que no queremos que los demás la conozcan. En este punto dudamos que los alcohólicos sean fundamentalmente peores que los demás. Se trate de quien sea, es cierto que beber complica las relaciones sexuales con la pareja. Después de algunos años de vida con un alcohólico, una mujer cae en un profundo agotamiento, llega a odiar al marido y no puede comunicarse con él. ¿Cómo podría ser de otra manera? El marido empieza a aislarse, a compadecerse. Va a los centros nocturnos, o a otros lugares del género, por algo más que alcohol. Quizás sostiene una relación secreta y satisfactoria con una chica «que comprende». Podemos decir que ella probablemente lo comprenda; pero, ¿qué hacer ante una situación como esta? Un hombre que se comporta así tiene grandes remordimientos, sobre todo si está casado con una mujer leal y valerosa que por causa suya vivió en un infierno.
      Cualquiera que sea la situación, hay que hacer algo para corregirla. Si estamos seguros de que nuestra mujer no sabe nada, ¿debemos decirle cómo están las cosas? No siempre — creemos. Si ella conoce la historia de modo general, ¿debemos explicarle los detalles? No hay ninguna duda de que debemos admitir nuestra culpa. Es probable que ella insista en conocer todo en detalle. Querrá saber quién es esa mujer y dónde vive. Tenemos la impresión de que es oportuno responderle que no tenemos el derecho de involucrar a otra persona. Estamos arrepentidos de lo que hicimos y, con la ayuda de Dios, ya no volveremos a lo mismo. No podemos hacer más y no tenemos el derecho de hacerlo. Aunque existen excepciones legítimas, a menudo hemos encontrado que éste es el mejor modo de proceder.
      Nuestro modo de vivir no puede ser una calle de un solo sentido. Es bueno tanto para el marido como para la mujer. Si nosotros podemos olvidar, ciertamente que ella también lo hará. Y, mejor todavía, no nombrar sin razón a la persona de quien ella pueda tener celos.
      Puede haber casos en los cuales la franqueza absoluta sea necesaria. Sólo nosotros mismos podemos apreciar una situación tan íntima. Puede suceder que, de común acuerdo y con el sentido común del amor conyugal, los dos esposos dejen al pasado lo que le pertenece al pasado. Cada uno de ellos puede rezar para poder actuar mejor, teniendo presente la felicidad del otro. Recordemos que estamos ante el más terrible de los sentimientos humanos: los celos Una buena estrategia nos indicará si conviene atacar este problema por sus flancos o de frente.
      Aunque no tengamos un problema de este tipo, tenemos mucho que hacer en familia. A veces, un alcohólico nos dirá que su único deber es no beber. De otra forma, si bebiese, ya no habría hogar. Pero debe hacer mucho más todavía para reparar sus faltas hacia su mujer o sus padres, a quienes ha maltratado tanto durante años. La paciencia de ciertas madres y de ciertas esposas de alcohólicos sobrepasa todo entendimiento. Sin ella, muchos de nosotros estaríamos ahora sin familia o, quizá, muertos.
      El alcohólico es como un huracán que por donde pasa destruye la vida de los otros. Lastima corazones, destruye relaciones amorosas, desenraiza los afectos. Su egoísmo y su falta de consideración constantes mantienen el hogar en un tumulto. Creemos que, cuando alguien dice que es suficiente estar abstemio, no sabe lo que está diciendo. Es como el campesino que al salir del refugio anticiclones se encuentra su casa en ruinas y le dice a su esposa: „No pasa nada, mujer. No te alarmes, lo importante es que el viento ha cesado.“
      Es necesario prever un largo periodo de reconstrucción. Y somos nosotros quienes debemos asumir la dirección. No será suficiente que refunfuñemos nuestro remordimiento y que despreciamos el pasado. Deberemos sentarnos junto con nuestra familia y analizar francamente el pasado, como ahora lo vemos, poniendo mucha atención de no criticar a nadie. Los errores de alguien de nuestra familia resultan evidentes, pero puede ser que nuestro comportamiento haya sido en parte su causa. Ahora nos ponemos a «pulir nuestra casa» con nuestra familia. Durante nuestra meditación, todos los días, pedimos a nuestro Creador que nos enseñe la paciencia, la tolerancia, la benevolencia y el amor.
      La vida espiritual no es una teoría. Es necesario que la vivamos. A menos que los nuestros no nos manifiesten su deseo, no deberemos apurarlos a vivir según los principios espirituales. Y no deberemos tampoco hablar continuamente con ellos al respecto. Cambiarán con el tiempo, ya lo veremos. Nuestro comportamiento los convencerá más fácilmente que los discursos. Debemos meternos en la cabeza que vivir con quien ha sido alcohólico por veinte o treinta años hace dudar a todos.
      Hay errores que no llegaremos a reparar totalmente. No debemos inquietarnos, si podemos decirnos honestamente que lo haríamos si tuviésemos la capacidad de hacerlo. Si no podemos visitar a ciertas personas, entonces les escribiremos una carta sincera. En ciertos casos podemos tener razones válidas para retrasar nuestras excusas. Pero no nos retrasaremos si no hay ninguna razón. Deberemos ser sensibles, llenos de tacto, indulgentes y humildes, sin ser serviles o aduladores. Como gente de Dios, nos apoyamos sobre dos piernas y no nos inclinamos ante nadie.
      Si nos esforzamos por hacer bien lo que es necesario en este periodo de nuestro quehacer, nos maravillaremos al descubrir que hemos completado la meta de nuestra obra. Conoceremos una nueva libertad y una nueva felicidad. No nos afligiremos por el pasado, pero tampoco nos empeñaremos en olvidarlo. Comprenderemos qué significa la palabra serenidad y conoceremos la paz. Poco importa a qué grado de abyección hayamos llegado, veremos cómo nuestra experiencia pueda ayudar a los demás. Desaparecerá toda idea de inutilidad de nuestra vida y también toda forma de conmiseración de nosotros mismos. Perderemos el interés por nuestros caprichos y nos dedicaremos a servirle a otros. El egoísmo desaparecerá. Nuestras ideas sobre la vida cambiarán como del día a la noche. El miedo a las personas y el miedo a la inseguridad económica nos abandonarán. Intuiremos cómo comportarnos frente a las situaciones que de ordinario nos desconcertaban. Nos daremos cuenta repentinamente de que Dios hace por nosotros lo que no podíamos hacer por nosotros mismos.
      No pensamos que se trate de promesas extravagantes. Se realizan en medio de nosotros, a veces rápidamente, a veces lentamente. Estamos ciertos de que se cumplirán si nosotros nos empeñamos en su realización.
      Esta reflexión conduce al Décimo Paso, que nos sugiere continuar haciendo nuestro examen de conciencia y reparar el mal que eventualmente vayamos haciendo. A medida que escombramos el pasado comenzamos a vivir esta nueva vida con vigor. Hemos entrado en el mundo del Espíritu. La labor que nos espera es crecer en comprensión y en eficacia. No es la obra de un día. Deberá durar toda nuestra vida. Necesitaremos cuidarnos del egoísmo, de la deshonestidad, del resentimiento y del miedo. Cuando estos sentimientos nacen en nuestro corazón, pedimos de inmediato a Dios alejarlos de nosotros. Hablamos de estos sentimientos con alguien y reparamos de inmediato nuestros errores, si hemos hecho mal a otros. Después, con toda nuestra resolución, dirigimos nuestros pensamientos a alguien a quien podamos ayudar. El amor y la tolerancia hacia los demás serán nuestro código ético.
      Y hemos cesado de combatir contra cualquiera o contra cualquier cosa, hasta contra el alcohol. Porque para entonces la razón nos habrá sido devuelta. Raramente sentiremos el deseo de beber. Si fuésemos tentados, nos alejaremos del alcohol como si fuese una flama. Reaccionamos de manera sana y normal, y comprobamos que estas cosas suceden automáticamente. Veremos que la tendencia a beber desaparecerá y que esta nueva actitud se nacerá en nosotros sin esfuerzo y sin pensar en ella. Será la cosa más natural. Y el milagro de nuestra vida. No combatimos al alcohol ni huimos de la tentación. Tenemos la impresión de estar colocados en una posición de neutralidad, seguros y protegidos. Ni siquiera hemos debido hacer la promesa de abstenernos del alcohol. El problema, por lo contrario, ha desaparecido. Para nosotros no existe. Nosotros no nos jactamos ni tenemos miedo. Esta es nuestra experiencia. Así reaccionamos, si nos mantenemos espiritualmente en plena forma.
      Para nosotros es fácil descuidar el programa espiritual y dormirnos en nuestros laureles. Si lo hacemos, nos encaminaremos hacia problemas, ya que el alcohol es un enemigo sutil. No estamos curados del alcoholismo. Eso que nosotros poseemos, verdaderamente es un alivio contingente que depende de nuestro modo de mantenernos espiritualmente en forma. Cada día debemos intentar hacer la voluntad de Dios en todos nuestros actos: «¿Cómo Te puedo servir mejor? Qué Tu voluntad se haga (y no la mía).» Estos son pensamientos que debemos llevar siempre con nosotros. En este punto podemos mantener en ejercicio nuestra voluntad todo lo que queramos. Es el ejercicio que verdaderamente le conviene a nuestra voluntad.
      Ya hemos dicho muchas cosas sobre el hecho de que debemos recibir fuerza, inspiración y dirección de Aquél que todo lo sabe y todo lo puede. Si hemos seguido con cuidado esto, comenzamos a percibir la presencia de Su Espíritu en nosotros. Hasta cierto punto hemos llegado a tener conciencia de Dios. Hemos empezado a desarrollar este vital sexto sentido. Pero debemos ir aún más lejos y eso quiere decir que tenemos que hacer otras cosas.
      El Undécimo Paso sugiere la oración y la meditación. No debemos ser tímidos en esto de la oración. Personas mejores que nosotros rezan continuamente. La oración es eficaz si mostramos buena disposición y si hacemos los esfuerzos necesarios. Sería fácil mantenernos en lo vago del campo de la oración. Pero intentaremos ofrecerles algunas sugerencias precisas y útiles.
      Antes de acostarnos en la noche, pasamos revista, de manera constructiva, a nuestra jornada. ¿Odiamos a alguien? ¿Tuvimos resentimientos? ¿Fuimos egoístas, deshonestos o cobardes? ¿Debemos disculpas a alguien? ¿Llevamos dentro de nosotros cosas que debimos haberle platicado a otra persona, sin ninguna demora? ¿Fuimos buenos y comprensivos con todos? ¿Qué cosa hubiéramos podido hacer mejor? ¿Pensamos en nosotros mismos la mayor parte del día? ¿O pensamos en lo que podríamos hacer por los demás, en nuestra pequeña contribución que podremos aportar a la vida que transcurre? Mas debemos poner mucha atención en no caer en inquietudes, en remordimientos o en reflexiones depresivas, pues esto disminuirá nuestra posibilidad de ser útiles a los demás. Después de este examen de conciencia, le pedimos perdón a Dios, y le pedimos que nos haga saber las medidas adecuadas para mejorar nuestra conducta.
      Inmediatamente después de despertar, pensamos en la jornada que nos espera. Hacemos un plan y, antes de cmenzar, pedimos a Dios que guíe nuestros pensamientos, suplicándole alejar de nosotros toda autoconmiseración y todo comportamiento que pudiera ser deshonesto o egoísta. En estas condiciones, podemos usar nuestras facultades mentales con extrema seguridad, porque, después de todo, Dios nos ha dado una inteligencia para servirnos de ella. Nuestra inteligencia se elevará a una dimensión mucho más elevada, cuando nuestros pensamientos sean liberados de motivaciones egoístas. Cuando pensamos en la jornada que nos espera, quizás debamos afrontar dentro de nosotros a la indecisión. Pudiera ocurrir que no sepamos qué camino recorrer. Entonces pedimos a Dios que nos inspire, que nos haga decidir, una intuición. Nos tranquilizamos, tomamos las cosas con calma. No combatimos. Nos sorprendemos de poder encontrar buenas resoluciones después de haber hecho estas tentativas durante un cierto tiempo. Lo que tenía toda la apariencia de ser un golpe de suerte o una inspiración del momento, poco a poco se convierte en un hábito de nuestra mente. Como aún nos falta experiencia porque hace poco tiempo que iniciamos un contacto con Dios, es poco probable que seamos tocados por la inspiración todas las veces. Es posible también que paguemos esta presunción con toda clase de acciones y de ideas absurdas. No obstante, nos damos cuenta de que, con el tiempo, naturalmente, nuestro modo de pensar se avecindará más cerca de la inspiración. Poco a poco podremos fiarnos de ella.       Terminamos generalmente nuestra meditación con una oración
      en la que pedimos a Dios que nos haga saber, durante todo el día, cuál es el próximo paso que debemos dar y que nos conceda aquello que necesitamos para resolver tales problemas. En particular, pedimos no ser esclavos de las propias visiones personales, y nos cuidamos de pedir algo para nuestra ventaja. Podemos pedir alguna cosa para nosotros que sea también para el bien de otros. Ponemos mucha atención en que nuestra oración no sea formulada para obtener el cumplimiento de nuestros deseos egoístas. Muchos de nosotros han perdido mucho tiempo haciendo esto, y así no se obtiene ningún resultado. Puede usted fácilmente ver por qué.
      Si las circunstancias lo permiten, podemos pedir a nuestras esposas o a nuestros amigos unirse a nosotros en nuestra meditación de la mañana. Si la religión que profesamos requiere expresamente ciertas oraciones de devoción en la mañana, cumplimos este deber. Si no pertenecemos a ninguna religión, escogemos algunas veces oraciones que delineen los principios que hemos estudiado. Aunque hay muchos libros útiles, un sacerdote, un pastor o un rabino están capacitados para darnos sugerencias a este respecto. Dése rápidamente cuenta en qué cosa tienen razón las personas religiosas. Sírvase de aquello que le ofrezcan. Durante el día hacemos una pausa cuando estamos agitados o tenemos dudas, y pedimos luz y acción. Nos acordamos en todo momento de que ya no estamos para dirigir el espectáculo, repitiéndonos esta frase muchas veces durante el día: „Hágase Tu voluntad.” Entonces corremos mucho menos riesgos en lo que concierne a nuestros nervios, al miedo, la cólera, la inquietud, la autoconmiseración y las decisiones alocadas. Nos volvemos personas eficientes. No nos cansamos tan fácilmente, porque no quemamos más nuestra energía de manera alocada, como lo hacíamos cuando intentábamos organizar nuestra vida para complacernos a nosotros mismos.
      Este método es eficaz — lo es realmente.
      Nosotros, los alcohólicos, somos indisciplinados. Entonces dejemos que Dios nos discipline con el método tan simple que acabamos de explicar.
      Pero esto no es todo. Todavía hay muchas cosas que hacer. „La fe sin las obras es una fe muerta”. El próximo capítulo está enteramente dedicado al Duodécimo Paso.

    - |
      La experiencia de todos los días demuestra que nada es más eficaz para garantizar nuestra sobriedad, que un intenso trabajo en favor de otros alcohólicos. Esto funciona incluso donde las otras actividades no funcionan. Esta es nuestra duodécima sugerencia: ¡Lleve este mensaje a otros alcohólicos! Usted puede ayudarlos cuando ninguna otra persona pudo. Usted puede conquistar su fe cuando los demás no pudieron. Recuerde que los alcohólicos están seriamente enfermos.
      La vida adquirirá un nuevo significado. Observar a las personas que se restablecen, verlas ayudar a otros, notar cómo la soledad se desvanece, ver crecer alrededor de usted la solidaridad del grupo, tener una multitud de amigos: ésta es una experiencia de la cual no debe privarse usted. El frecuente encuentro con los nuevos que llegan como todos nosotros, es el aspecto alegre de nuestra vida.
      Quizás no conozca usted a ningún bebedor que quiera corregirse. Puede encontrarlos fácilmente, preguntando en su comunidad al médico, al sacerdote, o en el hospital. Ellos estarán muy contentos de responder a su solicitud. No comience como un evangelizador o reformador. Desdichadamente existen muchísimos prejuicios y se encontrará usted en posición desventajosa si los incita. Los sacerdotes y los médicos son competentes y si usted lo desea podrá aprender mucho de ellos, pero es un hecho que con la experiencia de bebedor, usted puede ayudar, como ningún otro, a otros alcohólicos. Por eso coopere; nunca critique. Servir es nuestro único propósito.
      Cuando descubra a un posible miembro de Alcohólicos Anónimos, trate de saber todo aquello que pueda sobre él. Si no tiene la intención de dejar de beber, no pierda el tiempo persuadiéndolo. Podría desperdiciar una posibilidad futura. Este consejo se dirige también a su familia. Ellos deben ser pacientes y darse cuenta de que están tratando con una persona enferma.
      Si da algún indicio de que esta vez quiere dejar de beber, platique con la persona que más se interesa en él — casi siempre su mujer. Hágase una idea de su comportamiento, de sus problemas, de sus antecedentes, de la gravedad de su estado y de su instrucción religiosa.
      Esta información le servirá para ponerse en su lugar, para comprender como querría usted que él se aproximara, si los papeles se invirtieran.
      A menudo es necesario esperar que él comience una juerga. La familia podría no estar de acuerdo con esto, pero a menos que él no esté en condiciones físicas peligrosas, es mejor correr este riesgo. No trate con él cuando esté en un estado de gran borrachera, a menos que se ponga violento y que la familia tenga necesidad de ayuda. Espere al final de la juerga o al menos un intervalo lúcido. Ahora deje que su familia o un amigo le pregunten si quiere dejar definitivamente de beber y si está dispuesto a hacer cualquier cosa para lograrlo. Si responde afirmativamente, entonces se le deberá hablar de usted como una persona que se ha restablecido. Es necesario que usted sea descrito como un miembro de una asociación de personas que, como parte de su rehabilitación, tratan de ayudar a otros y que se le diga que usted estará contento de hablar con él, si él desea recibir su visita.
      Si no quiere verlo, no trate de imponer su presencia. Ni la familia debe insistirle que haga alguna cosa, ni hablarle mucho de usted. Es mejor esperar al final de su próxima parranda. Quizás usted puede colocar este libro donde él lo vea. Aquí no se puede dar ninguna regla específica. La familia debe decidir al respecto. Pero exhórtela a no acelerar demasiado las cosas, porque esto podría comprometer el futuro.
      La familia deberá evitar contar la historia de usted. Si es posible, evite encontrar al alcohólico por mediación de la familia. Es mejor abordarlo por medio de un médico o una institución. Si él tiene necesidad de recuperarse en un hospital, está bien, mas no a la fuerza, a menos que sea violento. Deje que sea el médico, si éste así lo desea, el que le diga que puede ofrecerle la vía de una solución.
      Cuando su hombre esté mejor, el médico podrá proponerle una visita. Aun cuando usted ya haya hablado con la familia, déjela fuera de la primera entrevista. Así, su alcohólico verá que no se ejerce ninguna presión sobre él. Se dará cuenta de que puede tratar con usted sin ser fastidiado por la familia. Visítelo cuando aún esté agitado. Quizá sea más receptivo cuando se encuentre deprimido.
      Si es posible, vea a su hombre a solas. Entable al principio una conversación sobre temas generales. Después lleve la plática hacia cualquier tema relacionado con la bebida. Háblele de sus propios hábitos de bebedor, de sus síntomas y de su experiencia, para que él se anime a hablar de sí mismo. Si desea hablar, déjelo que lo haga. Así, usted tendrá una idea más exacta del método que deberá adoptar. Si no está de humor para hablar, esboce un cuadro de su propia carrera de bebedor hasta el momento en que dejó de beber. Pero, por el momento, no diga nada sobre cómo ocurrió eso. Si está serio, deténgase  hable sobre los disturbios que el alcohol le ha acarreado a usted, pero esté atento de no hacer una prédica o una disertación. Si está alegre, relátele alguna historia cómica de sus escapadas. Estimúlelo a que cuente alguna suya.
      Cuando haya comprendido que usted es un experto en todos los trucos de los bebedores, comience a describirse como un alcohólico.
      Relátele cómo estaba desconcertado y cómo al fin comprendió que estaba enfermo. Descríbale sus esfuerzos por dejar de beber. Muéstrele las piruetas mentales que conducen a la primera copa de una borrachera. Le sugerimos proceder como indicamos ya en el capítulo sobre el alcoholismo. Si él es un alcohólico, comprenderá de inmediato. Comparará su inconsistencia mental de entonces con cualquier cosa que le esté sucediendo a él mismo.
      Si usted está persuadido de que él es realmente un alcohólico, comience a insistir sobre el carácter incurable del mal. Muéstrele cómo, por su propia experiencia, la extraña condición mental en torno a aquella primera copa impide el funcionamiento normal de la fuerza de voluntad. En este primer estadio no haga alusión a este libro, a menos que él lo haya visto y desee discutirlo. Y cuídese de no definirlo como un alcohólico. Déjelo que él mismo saque sus propias conclusiones. Si se obstina en pensar que aún puede controlarse en la bebida, dígale que posiblemente sí pueda — si no es demasiado alcohólico. Pero insista en el hecho de que está gravemente afligido por este mal, que serán bien pocas las esperanzas de que pueda salir por sí mismo.
      Continúe hablando del alcoholismo como una enfermedad, una fatal enfermedad. Hable de las condiciones del cuerpo y de la mente que la acompañan. Mantenga su atención centrada sobre su propia experiencia. Explique cómo muchos que ni siquiera se han enterado de su gravedad, ya están condenados. Los médicos se muestran con justicia renuentes a decir toda la verdad a sus pacientes alcohólicos, a menos que eso sirva para lograr un buen propósito. Masusted puede hablarle de la fatalidad del alcoholismo, porque usted ofrece una solución. Bien pronto, nuestro amigo admitirá tener muchas, si no es que todas, de las características del alcohólico. Si el médico está de acuerdo en decirle que es un alcohólico, tanto mejor. Aunque su protegido no admita enteramente su estado, tendrá mucha curiosidad en saber cómo le ha hecho usted. Déjelo que él haga la pregunta, si lo desea. Relátele exactamente aquello que le ocurrió. Subraye libremente el aspecto espiritual. Si él fuese agnóstico o ateo, recalque el hecho de que no tiene necesidad de concordar con vuestra concepción de Dios. Puede escoger cualquier concepción que le plazca, siempre que signifique algo para él. Lo importante es que él esté dispuesto a creer en un Poder superior a él y que viva siguiendo principios espirituales.
      Al tratar con tal persona es preferible que usted use un lenguaje de todos los días para explicar los principios espirituales. No es bueno despertar prejuicios que él pueda tener contra cierta terminología o contra ciertos conceptos teológicos sobre los cuales pudo haber tenido ideas confusas. No destaque tales cuestiones, cualesquiera que sean sus propias convicciones.
      Puede darse el caso que su interlocutor pertenezca a una determinada religión. Sus conocimientos y su formación en la materia pueden ser muy superiores a los de usted. En tal caso, él se preguntará cómo podrá usted agregar alguna cosa a cuanto él ya sabe. Pero tendrá curiosidad en saber cómo entonces sus convicciones no le han funcionado, mientras que las suyas parecen funcionar tan bien. Él puede constituir una prueba de que la sola fe no basta. Para ser vital, la fe debe ir acompañada por el sacrificio personal y por la acción desinteresada y constructiva. Hágale ver que usted no está ahí para enseñarle la religión. Admita que probablemente él sepa más que usted, pero atraiga su atención sobre el hecho de que, no obstante lo profundo que puedan ser su fe y su saber, él no pudo haberlos puesto en práctica, pues de otra manera no bebería así. Quizá su propia historia pueda ayudarlo a comprender dónde no puso en práctica aquellos mismos preceptos que conoce tan bien. Nosotros no representamos a ninguna fe o secta particular. Nos servimos sólo de principios generales comunes a casi todas las religiones.
      Delinee el programa de acción explicando cómo hizo usted una evaluación de sí mismo, cómo enderezó su pasado y por qué está tratando de serle útil. Es importante que él se dé cuenta de que la tentativa de usted de transmitirle este mensaje juega un papel fundamental en su propio proceso de recuperación. Efectivamente, puede suceder que él lo ayude a usted más que usted a él. Aclare bien que él no está en deuda con usted y que usted sólo espera que él trate de ayudar a otro alcohólico cuando haya superado su dificultad personal. Hágale comprender qué importante es anteponer el bien de otros al de uno. Aclare que usted no quiere presionarlo y que no es necesario que él vuelva a verlo si no lo desea. Usted no se ofenderá si no quiere volver a verlo, porque él ya lo ha ayudado a usted más que usted a él. Si su plática fue sensata, calmada y plena de comprensión humana, quizás usted ha hecho un amigo. Puede darse el caso de que lo haya turbado con la cuestión del alcoholismo. Esto es sólo para bien. Entre más sienta que es un caso desesperado, mejor. Es más probable que el siga sus sugerencias.
      Quizá su interlocutor pueda dar razones por las cuales no tenga necesidad de seguir todo el programa. Puede rebelarse ante la idea de volver a ver drásticamente todo su pasado, que implica hablar con otras personas. No contradiga tales opiniones. Dígale que usted un día pensaba así, pero que le es difícil pensar que hubiese progresado si no hubiera actuado como lo hizo. En la primera visita háblele de la Agrupación de Alcohólicos Anónimos. Si muestra interés, enséñele una copia de este libro.
      A menos que nuestro amigo desee hablar más sobre él mismo, no abuse de su hospitalidad. Déjele la posibilidad de reflexionar. Si usted permanece más tiempo, déjelo que lleve la conversación hacia donde él quiera. A veces el neófito está deseoso de ir de inmediato al programa de recuperación y usted podría estar tentado a permitírselo. Esto es a veces un error. Si más tarde se encontrara en dificultades, podrá decir que usted lo apresuró. Usted tendrá mucho más éxito con los alcohólicos, si no muestra mucha pasión por las cruzadas o las reformas. No hable nunca a un alcohólico de una presunta superioridad moral o espiritual; ponga simplemente ante él el ajuar de instrumentos espirituales para que él los inspeccione. Muéstrele cómo funcionaron en usted. Ofrézcale una sólida amistad y fraternidad. Dígale que si él quiere restablecerse, usted hará todo para ayudarlo.
      Si su solución no parece interesarlo, o si él espera solamente que usted actúe como un banquero para resolver sus dificultades financieras, o como un enfermero para sus juergas, debe entonces renunciar a ocuparse de él hasta cuando haya cambiado de parecer. Lo hará después que se haya procurado un poco más de daño.
      Si en cambio él muestra un sincero interés en volver a verlo, pídale que lea este libro entretanto. Después de esto, él mismo deberá decidir si quiere continuar en esta dirección. No debe ser empujado o presionado por usted, por su esposa o por sus amigos. Si ha de encontrar a Dios, el deseo debe venir de su interior.
      Si piensa poder resolver su problema de cualquier otro modo, o si prefiere algún otro acercamiento espiritual, anímelo a seguir su propia conciencia. Nosotros no tenemos el monopolio de Dios, tenemos simplemente un acercamiento que para nosotros ha sido eficaz. Pero hágale notar que nosotros los alcohólicos tenemos muchos puntos en común y que, en cualquier forma, a usted le gustaría ser amistoso. No trate de decir más.
      No se desanime si no encuentra una inmediata respuesta. Busque a otro alcohólico e intente de nuevo. Tenga la certeza de que encontrará a alguien bastante desesperado que aceptará con gusto aquello que usted le ofrezca. Pensamos que es un pérdida de tiempo arrinconar a un hombre que no puede o no quiere cooperar con usted. Si usted lo deja, puede suceder que pronto se convenza de que no puede recuperarse él solo. Empeñar demasiado tiempo en un caso significa privar a otro alcohólico de la posibilidad de vivir y ser feliz. Uno de nuestros miembros fue un completo fiasco con su primera media docena de candidatos. Dice a menudo que si hubiera continuado ocupándose de ellos, quizás habría privado de su oportunidad a muchos otros que con el tiempo se restablecieron.
      Supongamos ahora que usted hace una segunda visita a una persona. Ella ha leído este libro y dice estar dispuesta a pasar por los Doce Pasos del programa de recuperación. Como usted mismo ha vivido la experiencia, siente que puede darle diversos consejos prácticos. Hágale comprender que está a su disposición si decide intentar y si quiere contar suhistoria, pero no insista si él quiere consultar a alguna otra persona.
      Puede ser que esté sin un centavo y que no tenga casa. Si es así, usted podría ayudarlo a encontrar un empleo o darle una pequeña ayuda financiera. Pero no debe privar a su propia familia o a sus acreedores del dinero que ellos esperan. Puede también pensar en llevar a este hombre a su casa por algunos días. Mas asegúrese de usar la discreción. Asegúrese de que él sea bien acogido por su familia y de que no trate de imponerse para obtener dinero, relaciones o asilo. Si usted lo permitiera, no haría más que dañarlo. Lo estaría empujando a ser insincero. Mas que ayudarlo en su recuperación, usted estaría ayudándolo a destruirse.
      Nunca evite estas responsabilidades, pero tenga la certeza de hacer las cosas justas, asumiéndolas. La ayuda dada a otros es la piedra fundamental de su propia recuperación. Un acto gentil de vez en cuando no basta. Debe actuar como buen Samaritano todos los días, si es necesario. Eso puede significar la pérdida de muchas noches de sueño, una gran interferencia en sus pequeños placeres, una interrupción en sus ocupaciones. Puede significar abrir su cartera y su casa, asesorar a mujeres y parientes frenéticos, innumerables viajes a las delegaciones de policía, psiquiátricos, hospitales, cárceles y asilos. Su teléfono puede sonar a cualquier hora del día o de la noche. Su mujer quizá diga que usted la ha descuidado. Un borracho puede romper los muebles de su casa o quemar un colchón. Puede encontrarse en la situación de tener que luchar con él, si es violento. A veces tendrá que llamar a un médico para que le suministre sedantes, a la policía o una ambulancia. A veces deberá enfrentar situaciones de este género.
      Nosotros raramente le permitimos a un alcohólico que viva en nuestras casas por largo tiempo. Esto no es bueno para él y a veces crea serios inconvenientes en una familia. Si un alcohólico no responde a sus esfuerzos, no hay razón para que usted abandone a su familia. Debería continuar tratándola amigablemente. Debería ofrecerle su método de vida. Si ellos aceptan o practican los principios espirituales, hay más posibilidades de que el jefe de familia se restablezca. Y aunque continuase bebiendo, la familia encontrará la vida más soportable.
      Para el tipo de alcohólico capaz y deseoso de restablecerse es deseable un poco de caridad en el sentido ordinario del término. Aquéllos que imploran dinero y asilo antes de vencer al alcohol, están en la calle equivocada. Aun nosotros hacemos hasta lo imposible por procurarnos estas cosas, cuando realmente está justificado. Esto puede parecer contradictorio, pero no lo creemos así.
      No es el hecho de dar lo que está a discusión, sino mas bien el cuándo y el cómo dar. De esto depende a menudo el fracaso o el éxito. En el momento mismo en que nosotros ponemos nuestro trabajo en un plano de servicio, el alcohólico comienza a pensar más en nuestra asistencia que en la de Dios. Él reclama esto o aquello, declarando que no podrá vencer al alcohol sino cuando sus necesidades materiales hayan sido satisfechas. ¡Tonterías! Algunos de nosotros sufrimos gravísimos reveses antes de aprender esta verdad: Trabajo o no trabajo, mujer o no mujer, el hecho es que no cesamos de beber mientras dependimos de otras personas, en vez de depender de Dios.
      Imprima en la mente de todo hombre la idea de poder restablecerse sin considerar a nadie. La sola condición es que confíe en Dios y que limpie la casa (inventario moral de sí mismo).
      Y ahora el problema familiar. Puede haber divorcio, separación o simplemente relaciones tensas. Cuando su adepto haya saneado como mejor pueda la situación con su familia y haya explicado abiertamente los nuevos principios con base en los cuales vive, deberá poner en práctica esos principios en su casa. Aun si su familia tuviese culpa, él no debe ocuparse de ello. Deberá concentrar sus esfuerzos en demostrar la propia espiritualidad. Polémicas para establecer en qué parte está el error deben ser evitadas como la lepra. En muchas familias es una cosa difícil de hacer, mas debe hacerse si se quiere obtener un resultado. Si se actúa así algunos pocos meses, el efecto en la familia de un hombre de seguro va a ser grande. Las personas más incompatibles descubren tener una base sobre la cual se pueden encontrar. Poco a poco, la familia se dará cuenta de sus propias deficiencias y las admitirá. Ahora se podrán discutir en una atmósfera de buena voluntad y cordialidad.
      Después de haber visto resultados tangibles, la familia también deseará cooperar. Esto llegará naturalmente y a su debido tiempo, siempre y cuando el alcohólico continúe demostrando estar sobrio y ser respetuoso del sentimiento de los demás y servicial, sin importar lo que otros digan o hagan. Obviamente, muchos caemos debajo de esta norma muchas veces. Pero debemos tratar de reparar inmediatamente el mal hecho, si no queremos pagar la pena con una parranda.

      Si hubiese divorcio o separación, no será oportuno tener una prisa excesiva por reunir a la pareja. El hombre debe estar seguro de haberse restablecido. La mujer debe haber comprendido plenamente el nuevo modo de vivir de él. Si su convivencia va a reanudarse, es necesario que lo hagan sobre una base mejor que aquella precedente que no funcionó. Esto es con un espíritu y una actitud nuevos de parte de ambos. Algunas veces es mejor para todos los implicados que la pareja permanezca separada. Es evidente que no se puede fijar una regla. Es mejor que el alcohólico siga adelante con su programa día con día. Cuando el momento de rehacer la vida en común haya llegado, será evidente para ambas partes de la pareja.
      Que ningún alcohólico diga que no puede restablecerse si no vuelve a tener con él a toda su familia. Esto no es enteramente verdadero. En algunos casos, por una razón o por otra, la esposa no regresará jamás. Recuérdele a su hombre que su restablecimiento no depende de otras personas, sino de su relación con Dios. Hemos visto restablecerse a hombres cuya familias nunca se les han unido. Hemos visto a otros recaer cuando la familia se reunió demasiado pronto.
      Los dos, usted y el recién llegado, deben avanzar día a día sobre la vía del progreso espiritual. Si persisten, ocurrirán cosas notabílisimas. Al mirar hacia atrás nos damos cuenta de que cuanto ha ocurrido desde que nos pusimos en las manos de Dios, ha sido mejor que cualquier otra cosa que hubiéramos podido tratar de hacer solos. Siga los dictados de un Poder Superior y vivirá efectivamente en un mundo nuevo y maravilloso, cualquiera que sea su actual situación.
      Cuando esté trabajando con un hombre y su familia, ponga atención para que no se inmiscuya en sus disputas. Si lo hiciera, podría arruinar su posibilidad de ser útil. Pero hágales comprender a los familiares que ese hombre ha estado muy enfermo y que debe ser tratado en consecuencia. Debe prevenirlos para que no susciten resentimientos o celos. Debe hacerles comprender que sus defectos de carácter no pueden desaparecer en una noche. Muéstreles que él ha entrado en un periodo de crecimiento. Pídales recordar, cuando aumente su impaciencia, el bendito milagro de su sobriedad.
      ￼
      Si usted tuvo éxito en resolver sus propios problemas domésticos, relate a la familia del recién llegado cómo eran las cosas. De este modo puede colocarlos sobre la buena ruta sin criticarlos. El relato de cómo usted y su mujer resolvieron sus dificultades es más válido que cualquier crítica.
      Supongamos que somos espiritualmente fuertes, así podremos hacer una cantidad de cosas que, se piensa, están prohibidas al alcohólico. Mucha gente ha dicho que no debemos ir adonde se sirven licores; que no debemos tenerlo en nuestras casas; que debemos huir de los amigos que beben; que debemos evitar las películas que muestren escenas de bebedores; que no debemos entrar en un bar; que nuestros amigos deben esconder las botellas cuando vayamos a visitarlos; que no se nos debe recordar en absoluto el alcohol. Nuestra experiencia demuestra que no es necesariamente así.
      Nos encontramos en estas circunstancias cada día. Un alcohólico que no sepa afrontarlas demuestra aún una mentalidad de alcohólico; esto es algo que no va bien con su estado espiritual. Su única posibilidad de permanecer sobrio sería vivir en algún lugar como el Casquete Polar de Groenlandia, y aun ahí algún esquimal podría enseñarle una botella de escocés... ¡y arruinarlo todo! Pregúntele a cualquier esposa que haya mandado a su marido a un lugar lejano para sacarlo del problema del alcohol.
      Creemos que cualquier sistema para combatir el alcoholismo que se proponga poner al enfermo a salvo de las tentaciones, está destinado al fracaso. Si el alcohólico intenta aislarse por un tiempo, puede tener éxito por un cierto tiempo, pero generalmente va al encuentro de una explosión alcohólica más violenta que nunca. Nosotros pusimos en práctica esta clase de métodos. Estas tentativas de lograr lo imposible siempre fracasaron.
      Y por eso nuestra regla de no evitar los lugares donde se bebe, si teníamos un buen motivo para estar ahí. Esto incluye bares, centros nocturnos, bailes, recepciones, bodas, aun los ordinarios entretenimientos en los que hay un poco de alegría. A una persona que haya tenido una experiencia con un alcohólico, le podría parecer que esto es como tentar a la Providencia, pero no es así.
      Notarán que pusimos una condición importante. Por lo tanto, 97
      ￼
      pregúntese usted mismo cada vez: „¿Tengo una buena razón social, de negocios o personal para estar en tal lugar? O estoy esperando robar un poco de placer sustituto de la atmósfera de tales lugares?”
      Si su respuesta a estas preguntas es positiva, no tiene por qué temer. Ir o mantenerse alejado, lo que parezca mejor. Pero asegúrese de estar sobre un terreno espiritual sólido antes de aventurarse, y de tener un motivo verdaderamente válido para ir. No piense en aquello que podrá obtener de esta ocasión. Piense en aquello que usted podrá aportar. Si se siente vacilante, mejor debería tratar de ayuar a otro alcohólico.
      ¿Por qué estar sentado con la cara larga en un sitio donde se bebe, suspirando por los días felices de otro tiempo? Si se trata de una ocasión feliz, trate de aumentar el gozo de los presentes; si es una reunión de negocios, vaya y haga con entusiasmo lo que tenga que hacer. Si está en compañía de una persona que desee comer en un bar, vaya sin preocupación. Hágales comprender a sus amigos que no deben cambiar sus hábitos por consideración a usted. En el momento oportuno explique a todos sus amigos por qué el alcohol no se hizo para usted. Si da estas explicaciones sin reticencia, muy pocos le pedirán que vuelva a beber. Al mismo tiempo que bebía, usted se iba retirando de la vida, poco a poco. Ahora está retornando a la vida de relaciones con el mundo. No comience a retirarse de nuevo sólo porque sus amigos beben licor.
      Su empleo ahora consiste en estar allí donde usted pueda ser útil a otros, así que no dude de ir a cualquier parte si puede ser útil. No titubee cudo tenga que visitar el lugar más sórdido de la Tierra. Manténgase en la línea de fuego en esta vida y Dios lo cuidará de todo peligro.
      Muchos de nosotros tenemos licor en casa. A menudo lo necesitamos para hacer superar a los nuevos el malestar que sigue a una borrachera. Algunos de nosotros lo servimos a nuestros amigos, siempre y cuando ellos no sean alcohólicos. Sin embargo, algunos de nosotros piensan que no debemos servirle licor a nadie. Nunca nos ponemos a discutir sobre esto. Tenemos la impresión de que cada familia, considerando las propias circunstancias, debe decidir por sí misma.
      ￼
      Somos cuidadosos en no mostrar intolerancia o aversión hacia la bebida como hecho social. La experiencia demuestra que esta actitud no es de utilidad para nadie. Todo nuevo alcohólico busca este espíritu de tolerancia entre nosotros y se siente inmensamente aliviado cuando se da cuenta de que no somos quemabrujas. Un espíritu de intolerancia podría alejar a los alcohólicos, cuyas vidas podrían ser salvadas de no ser por semejante estupidez. Si somos intransigentes, tampoco ayudaríamos a la causa de la abstinencia, pues ni un bebedor entre mil acepta que alguien que le tiene aversión al alcohol le hable de su problema.
      Esperamos que un día Alcohólicos Anónimos pueda ayudar al público a darse mejor cuenta de la gravedad del problema del alcoholismo. Mientras tanto, si nosotros adoptamos un actitud amarga y hostil, nuestra acción no surtirá grandes efectos. Los bebedores no la soportarían.
      Después de todo, nuestros problemas nos los creamos nosotros. Las botellas no eran más que un símbolo. Además, hemos dejado de combatir a las personas y las cosas. ¡No podíamos actuar de otra manera!

    - A LAS ESPOSAS
    - |
      Con pocas excepciones, nuestro libro hasta ahora se ha ocupado de los hombres. Pero cuanto hemos dicho se aplica de la misma manera a las mujeres. Nuestra actividad en beneficio de las mujeres está aumentando. Hay abundancia de pruebas de que las mujeres pueden recuperar su salud tan fácilmente como los hombres.
      Pero por cada hombre que bebe, otras personas son arrastradas — la mujer que tiembla al pensar en la próxima embriaguez de su esposo; la madre y el padre que ven a su propio hijo irse a la ruina.
      Entre nosotros hay esposas, familiares y amigos cuyo problema ha sido resuelto, y también están aquéllos que aún no han encontrado una solución feliz. Deseamos que las mujeres de los Alcohólicos
      Anónimos se pongan en contacto con las esposas de aquéllos que beben demasiado. Cuanto ellas digan se aplicará a casi todos los que están ligados a un alcohólico por vínculos de sangre o afecto.
      Como mujeres de los Alcohólicos Anónimos, quisiéramos convencerlas de que podemos comprenderlas como quizás pocos puedan hacerlo; queremos analizar los errores que cometimos. Y quisiéramos comunicarles la convicción de que ninguna situación es demasiado difícil y ninguna desventura es demasiado grande para no poder superarlas.
      Hemos recorrido un camino difícil, sin duda. Nos hemos encontrado hace tiempo con nuestro orgullo herido, con la frustración, con la autoconmiseración, con la incomprensión y el temor. Compañeros nada agradables. Nos hemos sentido empujadas por una autocompasión llorosa o por un amargo resentimiento. Algunas de nosotras han ido de un extremo al otro, siempre esperando que un día los seres que amamos volvieran a ser los mismos de antes.
      Nuestra lealtad y el deseo de que nuestros maridos puedan andar con la frente alta y ser como los otros hombres, nos han colocado en toda clase de situaciones. Hemos sido altruistas, con un pleno espíritu de sacrificio. Hemos dicho innumerables mentiras para proteger nuestro orgullo y la reputación de nuestros maridos. Hemos rezado, hemos sulicado, hemos sido pacientes. Hemos reaccionado mal. Hemos huido. Hemos sido histéricas. Nos hemos dejado apoderar por el terror. Hemos buscado compasión. Nos hemos vengado, teniendo relaciones con otros hombres.
      Parece que nuestras casas se han convertido en verdaderos campos de batalla. En la mañana nos hemos besado y hemos hecho las paces. Los amigos nos han aconsejado dejar a nuestros maridos, y lo hemos hecho sólo para regresar poco después y esperar, siempre esperar. Nuestros maridos han jurado solemnemente dejar para siempre la bebida. Les creímos todo cuando nadie más hubiese podido o querido hacerlo. Después, al paso de unos pocos días, semanas o meses, una nueva recaída.
      Raramente invitábamos amigos, pues no sabíamos cómo o cuándo se iba a aparecer el jefe de la casa. Teníamos escasas relaciones sociales. Terminamos por vivir casi solas. Cuando nuestros maridos nos invitaban a salir, hacían tal consumo de alcohol que arruinaban la velada. Si, por lo contrario, no bebían nada, la autocompasión los convertía en unos aguafiestas.
      Ya no teníamos seguridad financiera. Los puestos estaban siempre en peligro o ya liquidados. Un carro blindado no hubiera sido suficiente para que el sobre con el dinero del sueldo llegara a casa. El efectivo en bancos se disolvía como la nieve en el mes de junio.
      A veces había otras mujeres. ¡Qué decepcionante era este descubrimiento; qué cruel era que nos dijeran que ellas entendían a nuestros maridos como nosotras no lo hacíamos!
      Los acreedores, los agentes judiciales, los enojados taxistas, los policías, los vagabundos, los amigos y, asimismo, las señoras que a veces acompañaban a casa a nuestros maridos, nos juzgaban inhospitalarias. „Aguafiestas, gruñona, fastidiosa”, nos decían. Al día siguiente, ellos volvían en sí y nosotras perdonábamos y tratábamos de olvidar.
      Tratamos de conservar en nuestros hijos el amor hacia su padre. A los más pequeños les dijimos que su padre estaba enfermo, cosa muy cercana a lo que en realidad pensábamos. Nuestros esposos golpearon a los niños, patearon las puertas, hicieron pedazos la cerámica de valor y le arrancaron las teclas al piano. En medio de este pandemonio se precipitaban a la calle, amenazándonos con irse a vivir para siempre con la otra mujer. En este estado de desesperación, nos emborrachamos — una embriaguez que pusiera fin a todas las borracheras. El resultado inesperado era que nuestros maridos parecían quedar complacidos.
      Quizás en este punto llegamos al divorcio y llevamos a los niños a casa de nuestra madre y de nuestro padre. Entonces, los padres de nuestros maridos nos criticaron severamente por esta deserción. Pero en general no nos fuimos. Nos quedamos, empujando hacia adelante. Finalmente encontramos un empleo para hacer frente a nuestra pobreza y la de nuestra familia.
      Recurrimos al consejo del médico cuando las parrandas se convirtieron más frecuentes. Los alarmantes síntomas físicos y mentales, los profundos remordimientos, la depresión y el complejo de inferioriad de nuestros amados, nos aterrorizaban y nos perturbaban. Como animales en equilibrio sobre una pelota, subíamos la cima paciente y fatigosamente, volviendo a caer exhaustas después de cada esfuerzo por alcanzar un terreno sólido. La mayoría de nosotras enfrentamos las fases finales en casas de salud, sanatorios, hospitales y prisiones. A veces eran explosiones de delirio y de locura. A menudo, la muerte estaba cerca.
      Naturalmente, en estas condiciones cometimos errores. Algunos de ellos provenían de nuestra ignorancia sobre el alcoholismo. A veces intuíamos que teníamos que tratar con enfermos. Si hubiésemos comprendido plenamente la naturaleza de la enfermedad del alcoholismo, nos habríamos comportado de otra manera.
      ¿Cómo podían ser tan incomprensivos, tan insensibles, tan crueles estos hombres que amaban a sus mujeres y a sus hijos? Pensábamos que no podía haber amor en los corazones de estas personas. Y cuando quedábamos convencidas de su falta de corazón, nos sorprendían con renovadas promesas y con nuevas atenciones. Por algún tiempo volvían a ser amables, sólo para hacer pedazos la nueva estructura de afecto. Si les preguntábamos el motivo por el cual habían vuelto a beber, replicaban con una estúpida excusa y no decían nada. Era así de desconcertante y desolador. ¿Nos habíamos equivocado tanto con los hombres con que nos habíamos casado? Cuando bebían eran unos extraños. A veces eran tan inaccesibles que daba la impresión de que un alto muro se había levantado alrededor de ellos.
      Y aunque no amaban a sus familias, ¿cómo podían ser tan ciegos en relación con ellos mismos? ¿Qué era de su juicio, de su sentido común, de su voluntad? ¿Cómo no se daban cuenta de que beber era para ellos la ruina? ¿Cómo podía suceder que ellos mismos reconocieran el peligro, para después volver a beber inmediatamente?
      Éstas son algunas de las preguntas que recorren la mente de toda mujer que tenga un marido alcohólico. Nosotras esperamos que este libro pueda responder cualquiera de ellas. Quizá su marido ha vivido en ese extraño mundo del alcoholismo, donde todo es distorsionado y exagerado. Usted se habrá dado cuenta de que la ama realmente con lo mejor de él mismo. Desde luego que existe la incompatibilidad, pero en casi todos los casos el alcohólico sólo parece ser no amoroso y desconsiderado; generalmente esto es así porque está trastornado y enfermo. Hoy la mayor parte de nuestros hombres son los mejores maridos y padres, como nunca lo fueron anteriormente.
      Procure no condenar a su marido alcohólico por cualquier cosa que diga o haga. Él es sólo una persona muy enferma e irrazonable. Trátelo, si puede, como si tuviese pulmonía. Cuando la haga enojar y la angustie, recuerde que está muy enfermo.
      Existe una importante excepción a lo que hemos dicho arriba. Nos damos cuenta de que algunos hombres son realmente mal intencionados y de que ninguna forma de paciencia traerá algún cambio. Un alcohólico de este tipo puede servirse de este capítulo como de un mazo para golpearla en la cabeza. No le permita que siga adelante. Si está segura de que es uno de este tipo, sería mucho mejor que lo dejara. ¿Es justo permitirle que arruine su vida y la de sus hijos, sobre todo cuando tiene delante un camino para poner fin a sus borracheras si realmente está dispuesto a pagar el precio?
      El problema con el cual usted se debate habitualmente, se encuentra en una de estas cuatro categorías :
      Primera: Su marido es quizá solo un fuerte bebedor. Su hábito de beber puede ser constante o puede intensificarse sólo en ciertas ocasiones. Quizás gaste demasiado dinero en licor. Esto puede cansarlo mentalmente y físicamente, pero él no se da cuenta. A veces les ocasiona problemas a usted y a sus amigos. Él piensa que puede beber su dosis de licor, que eso no le hará ningún daño y que beber es necesario para sus negocios. Se irritaría probablemente si alguien lo llamara alcohólico. Este mundo está lleno de personas como él. Alguno se moderará o parará, otros no. De estos que continúan, muchos se convertirán en verdaderos alcohólicos luego de cierto tiempo.
      Segunda: Su marido demuestra una falta de control, porque es incapaz de permanecer sobrio, en sus cinco sentidos, aun cuando quiera hacerlo. A menudo pierde el control de sí mismo cuando bebe. Admite que sí es verdad, pero está seguro de que la próxima vez se controlará. Ya ha comenzado a intentar, con o sin la cooperación de usted, varios métodos para reducir su número de tragos o mantenerse sin beber. Puede ser que comience a perder a sus amigos. Sus negocios a veces sufren las consecuencias. A veces se preocupa y comienza a darse cuenta de que no puede beber como los demás. A veces bebe en la mañana y durante el día para calmar su nerviosismo. Está lleno de remordimientos luego de una borrachera grave y le dice a usted que quiere abandonar el alcohol. Pero tiempo después de una juerga, empieza a creer de nuevo que podrá beber moderadamente la próxima vez. Nosotros opinamos que esta persona está en peligro. Éstas son las señas de un verdadero alcohólico. Quizás aún pueda ocuparse de sus negocios bastante bien. Está bien lejos de haber mandado todo a la ruina. Como decimos entre nosotras: „Quiere tener ganas de parar.”
      Tercera: Este marido ha ido mucho más lejos que el caso número dos. Similar en un tiempo, éste ha empeorado. Sus amigos se han alejado, su casa está semiarruinada y no está en condiciones de tener un empleo. Es probable que el médico haya sido llamado y que haya comenzado la larga serie de visitas a casas de salud y hospitales. Él mismo reconoce que no puede beber como las demás personas, pero no sabe por qué. Se aferra a la idea de que encontrará la forma de lograrlo. Puede haber llegado al punto de querer desesperadamente parar de beber y no poder hacerlo. Usted puede tener bastantes esperanzas en una situación como ésta.
      Cuarta: Puede tener un marido que la desespere totalmente. Ha estado internado en una institución tras otra. Es violento o aparece completamente loco cuando bebe. A veces bebe durante el trayecto del hospital a casa. Quizás ha tenido ya delirium tremens. Los médicos, sacudiendo la cabeza, le han sugerido a usted internarlo. Probablemente usted ya se vio en la necesidad de hacerlo. Este cuadro puede ser menos oscuro de lo que aparece. Muchos de nuestros maridos estaban en un estado así de avanzado. Y aun así se recuperaron.
      Regresemos ahora al caso número uno. Por extraño que parezca, es un caso difícil de enfrentar. Le gusta beber. Eso estimula su imaginación. Sus amigos le parecen más cercanos si comparten con el un whisky. Quizás a usted misma le da placer beber con él cuando no sobrepasa demasiado los límites. Han transcurrido noches hermosas, platicando y bebiendo junto a la chimenea. Quizá les gusten aquellas fiestas que serían monótonas sin licor. Nosotras mismas disfrutamos tales noches y pasamos momentos placenteros. Todas sabemos que los licores lubrican la vida social. Algunas de nosotras, mas no todas, sostienen que ofrecen algunas ventajas si se usan de manera razonable.
      El primer principio del éxito es que usted nunca se enoje. Si su marido se pone insoportable y usted debe dejarlo temporalmente, actúe, si puede, sin rencor. La paciencia y el buen humor son necesarios al máximo.
      La siguiente sugerencia es que no le diga lo que debe hacer respecto a beber. Si él se hace a la idea de que usted es una gruñona o una aguafiestas, sus probabilidades de realizar alguna cosa positiva se reducirán a cero. Esa idea le servirá a él como una excusa para seguir bebiendo. Le dirá que es un incomprendido. Ello le podrá traer noches solitarias a usted, porque buscará otra persona para consolarse — y no siempre será del sexo masculino.
      No deje que el hábito de beber de su marido interfiera las relaciones con sus hijos y sus amigos. Ellos necesitan su compañía y su ayuda. Es posible tener una vida plena y útil, aunque su marido siga bebiendo. Sabemos de mujeres valerosas y aun felices en estas condiciones. No se meta en la cabeza la idea de querer reformar a su marido. Podría no estar en condiciones de hacerlo, a pesar de todos sus esfuerzos.
      Sabemos bien que estas sugerencias son a veces difíciles de seguir, pero le ahorrarán muchos sufrimientos si usted las toma en cuenta. Su marido llegará a apreciar lo razonable de su posición y su paciencia. Esto le preparará el terreno adecuado para un discurso amistoso sobre su problema de alcoholismo. Trate de que sea él mismo quien saque a la luz el problema. Trate de no asumir una actitud crítica durante tal discusión. En vez de eso, intente colocarse en su lugar. Demuéstrele querer ser de ayuda, no criticarlo.
      Si sobreviene una discusión, usted puede sugerirle que lea este libro, o al menos el capítulo sobre alcoholismo. Dígale que ha estado preocupada, aunque quizás sin una buena razón. Dígale que piensa que debería conocer más a fondo el problema de los riesgos que corre bebiendo tanto. Demuéstrele que tiene fe en su capacidad para dejar de beber o moderarse. Dígale queno quiere ser una aguafiestas, que solamente le preocupa su salud. Todo eso lo inducirá entonces a interesarse en el alcoholismo.
      Probablemente haya varios alcohólicos entre sus conocidos. Podrá sugerirle que los dos se interesen en ellos. Los alcohólicos aman ayudar a otros alcohólicos. Su marido quizás quiera platicar con uno de ellos.
      Si este tipo de acercamiento no suscita el interés de su marido, será mejor que deje el asunto, pero después de una conversación amigable no es improbable que él mismo quiera retomar el tema. Esto requerirá una espera paciente, pero vale la pena. Mientras tanto podría tratar de ayudar a la mujer de otro alcohólico en estado avanzado. Si usted se atiene a estos principios, su marido quizá dejará de beber o beberá menos.
      Suponga, sin embargo, que su marido se ajusta a la descripción del caso número dos. Se podrán aplicar los mismos principios que para el caso número uno. Pero luego de la primera gran borrachera pregúntele si verdaderamente desea dejar de beber para siempre. No le pida que lo haga por usted o por alguien más. Sólo pregúntele si desea hacerlo.
      Con toda probabilidad lo desea. Muéstrele un ejemplar de este libro y dígale lo que ha aprendido acerca del alcoholismo. Persuádalo de que, como alcohólicos, los autores de este libro sí lo entienden. Cuéntele alguna de las historias interesantes que ha leído. Si lo encuentra poco inclinado hacia un remedio espiritual, pídale que al menos lea el capítulo sobre el alcoholismo. Quizá se interese lo suficiente para seguir.
      Si se entusiasma, su cooperación adquirirá un enorme significado. Si no muestra entusiasmo o sostiene que no es un alcohólico, le sugerimos dejarlo en paz. Evite forzarlo a seguir nuestro programa. La semilla ha sido sembrada en su mente. Él sabe que miles de hombres como él se han restablecido. Pero no se lo recuerde después que haya bebido, porque podría resentirse. Antes o después probablemente descubrirá que ha vuelto a leer este libro. Espere hasta que las repetids recaídas lo convenzan de que debe actuar, porque entre más lo apresure usted, más tardará en lograr su restablecimiento.
      Si su marido pertenece a la tercera categoría, probablemente usted sea afortunada. Una vez con la certeza de que sí quiere dejar de beber, podrá ir a su encuentro con este libro tan alegre como si hubiese descubierto un pozo petrolero. Tal vez él no comparta su entusiasmo, pero en la práctica de seguro leerá el libro y quizás adopte de inmediato el programa. Si no lo hace, probablemente usted no tendrá que esperar mucho. Pero, de nuevo, no lo presione. Déjelo que decida él mismo. Alegremente véalo pasar por más parrandas. Háblele de su condición o de este libro sólo cuando él mismo aborde tales temas. En algunos casos será mejor que alguien ajeno a la familia sea el que le muestre el libro. Podrán estimularlo para que actúe sin suscitar hostilidad. Si su marido es un hombre normal en otros sentidos, sus posibilidades de éxito en esta etapa son muchas.
      Usted podría suponer que los hombres que pertenecen a la cuarta categoría no tienen esperanzas. Pero no es así. Muchos de los Alcohólicos Anónimos eran así. Todos los habían desahuciado. El fracaso parecía cierto. A pesar de todo, estos hombres se han recuperado de una manera espectacular y prodigiosa.
      Hay excepciones. Algunos estaban tan dañados por el alcohol que ya no pudieron detenerse. A veces el alcoholismo se complica con otros desórdenes. Un buen doctor o un psiquiatra pueden decir si estas complicaciones son graves. En cualquier caso, procure que su marido lea este libro. Puede ocurrir que le interese. Si él ya está recuperándose en una institución, pero usted y su médico están convencidos de que desea salvarse, dénle la oportunidad de intentar nuestro método, a menos que el médico piense que su condición mental es demasiado anormal o peligrosa. Hacemos esta recomendación con suficiente fe. Hace aproximadamente un año, un hospital estatal dio de alta a cuatro alcohólicos crónicos. Se tenía la plena seguridad de que todos ellos regresarían en unas pocas semanas. Sólo uno de ellos regresó. Los demás no han tenido ninguna recaída. ¡Profundo es el poder de Dios!
      Usted puede encontrarse en una situación opuesta. Quizá tenga a su marido en libertad, pero debería estar confinado. Algunos no pueden o no quieren salir del alcoholismo. Cuando se vuelven demasiado peligrosos, pensamos que lo mejor es encerrarlos. Por supuesto que se tiene que consultar a un doctor. Las esposas y los hijos de tales hombres sufren horriblemente, pero no más que ellos mismos.
      Algunas veces se debe empezar una nueva vida. Conocemos a mujeres que lo han hecho. Si las mujeres que están en esta situación adoptan un modo de vida espiritual, su camino será más fácil.
      Si su marido es un bebedor, probablemente usted se preocupará por aquello que los demás piensen y detestará encontrarse con sus amigos. Se encerrará más en sí misma y supondrá que todos están hablando de su situación. Evitará tocar el tema del alcoholismo incluso con sus propios padres. No sabrá qué cosa decir a los niños. Cuando su marido esté mal, usted se aislará temblando, con el único deseo de que jamás se hubiese inventado el teléfono.
      Encontramos que la mayor parte de estas inquietudes son innecesarias. Así, no es necesario hablar largamente del caso de su marido, puede dar a conocer con calma a sus amigos la naturaleza de su enfermedad. Pero debe cuidar de no molestar o dañar a su marido.
      Cuando les haya explicado cuidadosamente a estas personas que su marido es una persona enferma, se habrá creado una nueva atmósfera. Las barreras que se habían levantado entre usted y sus amigos desaparecerán para dejar su lugar a una corriente de simpatía y comprensión. Ya no se sentirá molesta ni será necesario que busque excusas, como si su marido fuese de carácter débil. Él será todo lo que se quiera menos débil. Su nuevo valor y su seguridad en usted misma harán maravillas en el plano social.
      El mismo principio es aplicableen las relaciones con sus hijos. A menos que ellos necesiten realmente protección contra su padre, es mejor no tomar parte en las discusiones que tengan con él cuando bebe. Use sus energías para promover una mejor comprensión en todas direcciones. La terrible tensión que aprisiona la casa de todo alcohólico comenzará a atenuarse.
      Frecuentemente usted se ha sentido obligada a hablar con el jefe de su marido y con sus amigos para decirles que él estaba enfermo, cuando en realidad estaba borracho. Evite responder a sus preguntas tanto como sea posible. Deje que su marido las responda. Su deseo de protegerlo no deberá empujarla a mentir, porque las personas tienen derecho a saber lo que él está haciendo. Platique esto con él cuando esté sobrio y de buen humor. Pregúntele qué debe hacer usted si él la coloca en esa posición otra vez. Pero tenga cuidado de no guardar resentimientos de la última vez que lo hizo.
      Hay otra forma de miedo paralizante. Usted puede temer que su marido pierda su empleo; sted piensa en la desgracia y en los tiempos difíciles que van a pasar usted y los niños. Probablemente viva esta experiencia o quizá ya la haya pasado varias veces. Si le vuelve a ocurrir, mírela bajo una luz diferente. ¡Quizá resulte ser una bendición! Probablemente convenza a su marido para que quiera dejar de beber. ¡Y ahora usted sabrá que, si quiere, él puede parar! A veces, esta aparente calamidad ha sido para nosotros una bendición, porque ha abierto un camino que lleva a descubrir a Dios.
      Hemos delineado por todos lados cómo la vida adquiere una mejor calidad cuando es vivida en un plano espiritual. Si Dios puede resolver el problema del alcoholismo, que es tan viejo como el mundo, podrá también resolver sus problemas. Nosotros, las mujeres de los alcohólicos, descubrimos que, como todos los demás, estábamos llenas de orgullo, de autocompasión, de vanidad y de todos los sentimientos que alimentan el egocentrismo; y que no estábamos ciertamente libres de egoísmo o deslealtad. Cuando nuestros esposos empezaron a aplicar principios espirituales en sus vidas, empezamos a ver que era bueno que nosotras también los aplicáramos.
      Al principio, algunas de nosotras no creíamos que hubiese necesidad de esta ayuda. Pensábamos, en forma general, que éramos muy buenas mujeres, capaces de ser mejores si nuestros maridos paraban de beber. Pero la idea de que éramos demasiado buenas para necesitar a Dios era muy tonta. Hoy tratamos de poner en práctica los principios espirituales en cada área de nuestras vidas. Cuando lo hacemos, encontramos que también se solucionan nuestros problemas: La consiguiente ausencia de miedo, de preocupación y de dolor es una cosa estupenda. Las animamos a probar nuestro programa, pues nada ayudará tanto a su marido como la actitud radicalmente distinta de usted hacia él, actitud que Dios le enseñará a adquirir. Camine al lado de su marido, si puede.
      Si usted y su esposo encuentran una solución para el apremiante problema de la bebida, usted va a ser feliz, desde luego. Mas todos los problemas no se resolverán de una sola vez. La semilla ha empezado a germinar en un nuevo suelo, pero el crecimiento apenas ha comenzado. A pesar de su recién encontrada felicidad, habrá altibajos. Muchos de los viejos problemas permanecerán con usted. Es así como debe ser.
      La fe y la sinceridad tanto de usted como de su marido serán puestas a prueba. Tales contrariedades deberán ser consideradas como parte integrante de su educación; es a través de ellas que usted aprenderá a vivir. Cometerá errores, pero si ha sido honesta consigo misma, no se dejará abatir. A veces podrá utilizarlos válidamente. Cuando los haya superado, habrá empezado un nuevo estilo de vida.
      Alguno de los escollos que encontrará son la irritación, la susceptibilidad herida y los resentimiento. Su marido será a veces ilógico y usted querrá criticarlo. Un punto negro sobre el horizonte doméstico podrá transformarse en una gran nube temporal. Estas discordias familiares son muy peligrosas, especialmente para su marido. A menudo, usted deberá asumir la responsabilidad de evitarlas o de tenerlas bajo control. No olvide que el resentimiento es un riesgo mortal para el alcohólico. Esto no significa que debamos batirnos en retirada ante nuestro marido cada vez que surja una honesta diferencia de opiniones. Sólo tenga cuidado de no disentir con espíritu resentido o crítico.
      Ambos acordarán que les será más fácil resolver los problemas serios que aquellos insignificantes. La próxima vez que sostengan una discusión acalorada, sin importar cuál sea el motivo, cualquiera tendrá el privilegio de sonreír y decir: „Esto se está poniendo serio. Lamento haberme enojado. Platiquémoslo más tarde.” Si su marido está tratando de colocar su vida sobre una base espiritual, hará todo lo que esté de su parte para evitar desacuerdos o contiendas.
      Su marido sabe que le debe a usted algo más que la sobriedad. Y quiere corresponderle; pero no espere demasiado de él. Su modo de pensar y su modo de actuar son hábitos de muchos años. Paciencia, tolerancia, comprensión y amor son las palabras esenciales. Muéstrele estos sentimientos y él se los devolverá. La regla es vivir y dejar vivir. Si ambos recurren a la buena voluntad y con ella ponen remedio a sus defectos, no habrá necesidad de que se critiquen mutuamente. Nosotras las mujeres tenemos una imagen del hombre ideal, del tipo de hombre que quisiéramos ver encarnado en nuestro marido. Es la cosa más natural del mundo creer que, una vez resuelto el problema del alcoholismo, él estará a la altura de este ideal que concebimos hace mucho. Es probable que no resulte así porque, como
      usted, él está en el comienzo de su rehabilitación. Sea paciente. Muy probablemente también experimentaremos resentimiento por no haber podido curar a nuestros maridos con nuestro amor leal. No nos gusta la idea de que el contenido de un libro, o la obra de otro alcohólico, haya logrado en unas pocas semanas lo que nosotras buscamos durante años. En tales momentos olvidamos que el alcoholismo es una enfermedad sobre la cual no pudimos tener ningún poder. Su marido será el primero en decir que fue su devoción y cuidados lo que lo trajeron al punto donde pudo tener una experiencia espiritual. Sin usted, hace mucho tiempo que ya se hubiera hecho pedazos. Cuando se presenten pensamientos de resentimiento, trate de calmarse y haga el inventario de los beneficios recibidos. Después de todo, la familia está reunida, el alcohol ya no es un problema y usted y su marido
      están trabajando juntos para un futuro no esperado.       Otra dificultad consiste en los celos que podamos experimentar por las atenciones que él dedica a otras personas, especialmente alcohólicos. Hace mucho que usted deseaba su compañía y ahora él pasa largas horas ayudando a otros hombres y a sus familias. Usted piensa que él debería ser suyo ahora. El hecho es que él debe trabajar con otras personas para conservar su sobriedad. A veces se interesará tanto en esto que llegará a ser descuidado. Su casa estará llena de extraños. Probablemente algunos no le agraden a usted. Él se interesará en los problemas de ellos, pero no se ocupará lo suficiente de los suyos. No logrará mucho si subraya esto y pide más atención para usted. Vemos que es un grave error sofocar su entusiasmo por el trabajo relacionado con el alcoholismo. Usted debe unirse a él en sus esfuerzos, tanto como sea posible. Le sugerimos dirigir algunas de sus ideas a las esposas de sus nuevos amigos alcohólicos. Ellas necesitan el consejo y el amor de una mujer que ha vivido lo que usted.
      Probablemente usted y su esposo han estado viviendo muy solos, pues la bebida muchas veces aísla a la mujer de un alcohólico. Por lo tanto, usted necesitará nuevos intereses y nuevas motivaciones en su vida. Si en vez de lamentarse, usted colabora con él, descubrirá que su exceso de entusiasmo disminuirá. Ambos despertarán a un nuevo sentido de responsabilidad para con otros. Usted y su esposo deben pensar en lo que le pueden dar a la vida, en vez de pensar en lo que van a sacar de ella. Inevitablemente sus vidas serán más plenas al hacerlo. Perderán su antigua vida para encontrar una mucho mejor.
      Quizá su marido haga un buen comienzo sobre esta nueva base. Pero precisamente cuando las cosas van maravillosamente, a lo mejor la consterna regresando a casa ebrio. Si usted está convencida de que él realmente quiere superar la bebida, no tiene por qué alarmarse. Aunque es infinitamente mejor que no recaiga en absoluto, como ha sucedido con muchos de nuestros compañeros, no es algo malo en algunos casos. Su marido verá enseguida que debe redoblar sus actividades espirituales, si quiere sobrevivir. No necesita recordarle su deficiencia espiritual; él ya la sabe. Anímelo y pregúntele cómo puede serle más útil.
      El más pequeño signo de miedo o intolerancia pueden reducir las probabilidades de recuperación de su marido. En un momento de debilidad, él puede tomar el hecho de que usted desapruebe a sus amigos como una de aquellas excusas banales e irracionales para volver a beber.
      Nunca tratamos de regular la vida de un hombre para preservarlo de la tentación. La mínima tentativa, de parte suya, de dirigir sus empeños o sus actos para que no tenga tentaciones, será inútil. Que se sienta absolutamente libre de conducirse como él quiera. Esto es importante. Si se emborracha, usted no se culpe. O Dios ha quitado de su marido el problema del alcohol... o no. En tal caso, es mejor descubrirlo de inmediato. Ahora, usted y su marido pueden ir directamente a lo fundamental. Si se trata de evitar una recaída, coloque el problema, con todo lo demás, en manos de Dios.
      ￼
      Nos damos cuenta de que le hemos dado mucha dirección y muchos consejos. Puede parecer que hemos querido amonestarla. Si es así, lo lamentamos, pues nosotras no nos preocupamos mucho por la gente que nos amonesta. Lo que le hemos relatado está basado en nuestra experiencia, algunas veces dolorosa. Teníamos que aprender con dolor estas cosas. Es por esto que deseamos ardientemente que usted comprenda y evite las dificultades innecesarias.
      Así que a ustedes, que están „ahí afuera”, les decimos: „Buena suerte y que Dios las bendiga.”

    - LA FAMILIA Y LA RECUPERACIÓN
    - |
      Las mujeres en nuestra agrupación sugirieron algunas actitudes que una mujer puede asumir hacia el marido que está en vías de restablecerse. Quizá crearon la impresión de que él tiene que ser envuelto en algodones y colocado sobre un pedestal. La recuperación exitosa es exactamente lo contrario. Todos los miembros de la familia deben reunirse sobre un terreno común de tolerancia, comprensión y amor. Esto implica un proceso de consideración recíproca entre los miembros de la familia. El alcohólico, su esposa, sus hijos, sus parientes: probablemente cada uno tenga sus ideas preconcebidas sobre la actitud de la familia hacía él o ella. Cada uno desea que sus deseos sean respetados. Nos damos cuenta de que entre más concesiones pretende un miembro de la familia, más crece en los demás el resentimiento. Esto es causa de discordia y de infelicidad.
      ¿Y por qué? ¿No será quizás porque cada uno desea recitar la parte del actor principal? ¿No está cada quien tratando de imponer las reglas del espectáculo según sus propios deseos? ¿No está inconscientemente tratando de ver qué puede obtener de la familia, en vez de qué puede dar?
      El cesar de beber no es más que el primer paso para salir de una situación enormemente tensa y anormal. Un médico nos dijo: „El vivir por años con un alcohólico vuelve casi seguramente neuróticos a la esposa y a los hijos. La familia entera está, hasta cierta medida, enferma.” Es necesario que la familia comprenda, al emprender este viaje, que no siempre hará buen tiempo. Cada uno en su turno puede tener los pies adoloridos y permanecer a la zaga. Habrá atajos y desviaciones atrayentes por los cuales se podrá vagar y perderse.
      Déjenos indicarle algunos de los obstáculos que la familia encontrará; déjenos sugerirle el modo de evitarlos, así como de convertirlos en un beneficio para los demás. La familia de un alcohólico desea el retorno de la felicidad y la seguridad. Ella recuerda el tiempo en el cual el padre era afectuoso, activo y un hombre de éxito. La vida actual es comparada con aquellos años, y como ha desmerecido, la familia quizá sea desdichada.
      La confianza de la familia en su padre llega a un punto alto. La vida de antes, se piensa, regresará pronto. A veces se pretende que papá la haga retornar ¡al instante! Dios — ellos parecen creer — casi les debe esta recompensa desde hace mucho tiempo. Pero el jefe de la casa ha pasado años demoliendo los fundamentos de los negocios, de los afectos, de las amistades y de la salud, cosas semidestruidas o en la ruina. Llevará tiempo retirar los escombros. Aunque los viejos edificios serán remplazados por otros más bellos, pasarán años para que las nuevas construcciones sean terminadas.
      El padre sabe que tiene la culpa; habrá necesidad de trabajar duro durante un largo período, antes que se esté económicamente a gusto, pero no se le deben hacer reproches. Quizá ya no volverá a disponer de mucho dinero. Pero la familia sabia lo admirará más por lo que él está tratando de ser, que por lo que trate de ganar económicamente.
      De cuando en cuando la familia estará obsesionada con los fantasmas del pasado, ya que la carrera de bebedor de casi todo alcohólico ha quedado marcada con aventuras cómicas, humillantes, vergonzosas o trágicas. El primer impulso será el de esconder estos esqueletos en un cuarto obscuro y poner cerrojos a la puerta. Quizá la familia tiene todavía la idea de que la felicidad futura no puede basarse más que en el olvido del pasado. Nosotros pensamos que tal opinión es egocéntrica y está en conflicto directo con el nuevo modo de vivir recientemente instaurado.
      ￼
      Henry Ford dijo un día, muy sabiamente, que la experiencia es la cosa de mayor valor en la vida. Esto es cierto si se está dispuesto a hacer buen uso del pasado. Nosotros crecemos con nuestra buena voluntad de encarar los errores y corregirlos, transformándolos en un activo. El pasado del alcohólico llega a ser así el principal activo y casi siempre ¡el único activo de la familia!
      El doloroso pasado puede ser de inmenso valor y de ayuda para otras familias que aún luchan con su problema. Pensamos que cada familia que ha sido ayudada debe algo a aquéllas que aún no lo han sido, y cuando se presente la ocasión cualquiera de sus miembros debería estar dispuesto a sacar valerosamente de su escondite los errores de un tiempo, sin importarle cuán doloroso pueda resultarle esto. Para nosotros, mostrarles a los que sufren la manera en que hemos sido ayudados es lo que hace que valga la pena vivir la vida. Lleve en su pensamiento que en las manos de Dios el obscuro pasado es la más grande posesión que ahora tiene usted. Es la llave de la vida y de la felicidad de los demás. Con ella, usted les puede evitar la muerte y la infelicidad.
      Puede ocurrir que desenterrar las culpas del pasado se convierta en una plaga, en un verdadero flagelo. Por ejemplo, sabemos de casos en que el alcohólico o su mujer han tenido aventuras amorosas. En el transcurso de su primera experiencia espiritual, ellos se peonaron recíprocamente y se acercaron aun más. El milagro de la reconciliación estaba al alcance de la mano. Entonces, bajo el impulso de una provocación cualquiera, la parte herida desenterró la vieja historia y esparció rabiosamente las cenizas. Cualquiera de nosotros tiene experiencia de estas crisis y sabemos que hacen sufrir mucho. En algunos casos, marido y mujer han debido separarse por algún tiempo, antes de poder lograr un nuevo modo de ver las cosas, una nueva victoria sobre el amor propio herido. En la mayor parte de los casos, el alcohólico ha superado esta dura prueba sin recaer, pero no siempre. Opinamos por qué no se debe hablar, sin motivos buenos y útiles, de cuanto ha ocurrido en el pasado.
      Nosotros, los familiares de alcohólicos, mantenemos pocos esqueletos escondidos. Todos nosotros conocemos los problemas alcohólicos de los demás. Ésta es una situación que en la vida ordinaria sería fuente de incalculable dolor; podría haber chismes escandalosos; risa y maldad a expensas de otras personas y una tendencia a abusar de información íntima. Entre nosotros, esto ocurre raramente. Hablamos, en verdad, mucho de nosotros, pero casi siempre nuestras pláticas están templadas con un espíritu de caridad y tolerancia.
      Otro principio que observamos con extrema atención es el de no relatar experiencias íntimas de otra persona, a menos que ésta nos haya dado su autorización. Preferimos atenernos en lo posible a nuestras historias personales. Uno puede criticarse y reírse de sí mismo y esto les beneficiará a los demás, pero si la critica o el ridículo proviene de otra persona produce el efecto contrario. Los miembros de una familia deberían prestar mucha atención a estos principios, pues una observación desconsiderada o poco delicada puede suscitar un infierno. los alcohólicos somos gente susceptible. A algunos de nosotros les lleva mucho tiempo superar esta innata debilidad.
      Muchos alcohólicos son entusiastas. Pasan de un extremo a otro. Al principio de su recuperación, un hombre tomará como regla una de estas dos direcciones: podrá intentar, de manera frenética, consolidar nuevamente su posición económica, o podrá estar totalmente encantado con su nueva vida como para no hablar o pensar en otra cosa. En cualquiera de los dos casos se presentarán problemas familiares. Tenemos una abundante experiencia sobre esto.
      Consideramos peligroso que se lance de cabeza sobre la solución de su problema económico. La familia también se verá afectada, al principio placenteramente, ya que pensará que los problemas de dinero están por resolverse, y después ya no muy agradablemente, pues se sentirá descuidada. Papá podrá estar agotado en la noche y preocupado durante el día. Podrá interesarse poco en los hijos e irritarse cuando se le reproche su negligencia. Si no irritable, podrá parecer monótono y aburrido, no alegre y no afectuoso. Mamá podrá quejarse de que no se ocupa lo suficiente de ella. Todos estarán desilusionados y a menudo lo demostrarán. Ante tales quejas se levanta una barrera. Él tiene todos los nervios tensos por su esfuerzo para recuperar su fortuna y su reputación, y piensa que lo está haciendo bien.
      ￼
      Hay veces que la madre y los hijos no lo piensan así. Como en un tiempo fueron descuidados y maltratados, piensan que el padre les debe más de lo que les está dando. Desean que los colme de atenciones. Esperan que vuelvan los hermosos tiempos de antes, cuando no había exagerado en la bebida, y que se muestre arrepentido por lo que ellos han padecido. Pero el papá no se prodiga lo suficiente. El resentimiento aumenta. Él se vuelve aun menos comunicativo. Algunas veces explota por una pequeñez. La familia está desorientada. Todos lo critican y le hacen ver cómo viene a menos en su programa espiritual.
      Cosas como éstas pueden evitarse. Tanto el padre como la familia están en un error, aunque ambas partes pueden tener cierta justificación. Es inútil discutir, eso no hace más que agravar la situación. La familia debe comprender que papá, si bien extraordinariamente mejorado, aún está convaleciente. Ellos deben agradecer al cielo que él esté sobrio y sea capaz de insertarse de nuevo en la sociedad. Ellos deben elogiar sus progresos y recordar que su manera de beber causó una gran cantidad de daños, que para remediarlos pasará quizá mucho tiempo. Si intuyen estas cosas, no tomarán a lo trágico sus periodos de mal humor, de depresión o de apatía, los cuales desaparecerán cuando haya tolerancia, amor y comprensión espiritual.
      El jefe de la casa debe recordar que es el principal responsable de cuanto ha ocurrido en su casa. Ya mucho hará con poner orden durante todo el tiempo que le quede de vida. Pero debe aprender a ver el peligro que significa concentrarse demasiado en el éxito financiero. Aunque la recuperación financiera se nos presentará a nosotros, estamos de acuerdo en que no podemos dar preferencia al dinero. Para nosotros, el bienestar material siempre ha seguido al progreso espiritual, jamás ha sido al revés.
      Debido a que la familia es la que más ha sufrido, está bien que el hombre se consagre a ella. No es posible que vaya muy lejos en todas las demás direcciones si no comienza por mostrar altruismo y amor bajo el techo propio. Sabemos, y es verdad, que hay esposas y familias difíciles, pero el hombre que esté superando el alcoholismo debe recordar que él tuvo mucho que ver en ello.
      ￼
      Cuando cada miembro de una familia llena de resentimientos comienza a admitir sus propias deficiencias y las confiesa a otros, está poniendo las bases para una discusión constructiva. Estas conversaciones familiares serán de hecho constructivas si no hay discusiones acaloradas, conmiseraciones, justificaciones o críticas ásperas. Poco a poco, la madre y los hijos se darán cuenta de que exigen demasiado, y el padre verá que está dando demasiado poco. Dar más que recibir se convertirá en su principio de vida.
      Supongamos, por otro lado, que el padre haya tenido una experiencia espiritual excepcional. De un día para el otro se ha convertido, por así decirlo, en otro hombre. Se ha convertido en un entusiasta de la religión. Es incapaz de pensar en otra cosa. Apenas su sobriedad comienza a darse por descontada, puede ser que sus familiares miren al extraño nuevo papá con aprensión al principio y después con irritación. Desde la mañana hasta la medianoche no se habla más que de argumentos espirituales. Él puede pretender que la familia encuentre a Dios en un abrir y cerrar de ojos, o puede mostrar hacia ellos una indiferencia asombrosa y declarar ser superior a las consideraciones terrenas. A la mamá, que ha sido religiosa toda su vida, puede decirle que no ha comprendido nada de religión, que haría mejor en adoptar su tipo de espiritualidad mientras esté a tiempo de hacerlo.
      Cuando el padre toma esta vía, la familia, madre e hijos, puede reaccionar desfavorablemente. Incluso pueden estar celosos de un Dios que les ha robado el afecto de papá. Al mismo tiempo que están agradecidos de que él ya no beba, puede no agradarles la idea de que Dios haya hecho un milagro allí donde ellos no pudieron hacer nada. A menudo olvidan que ningún auxilio humano habría podido salvar a papá. Quizá no comprendan por qué su amor y su devoción no pudieron conducirlo de nuevo al camino recto. Después de todo — se dicen —, papá no es un tipo tan espiritual. Si él intenta reparar sus pasadas culpas, ¿por qué tanta preocupación por todo el mundo, menos por su familia? ¿Qué trata de decir con eso de que Dios se hará cargo de ellos? Empiezan a sospechar que ¡papá está un poco chiflado!
      Él no tiene tan poco equilibrio como ellos pudieran pensar.
      ￼
      Muchos de nosotros hemos experimentado la euforia de este papá. Tuvimos una intoxicación espiritual. Éramos como el pordiosero hambriento que, ajustándose el cinturón ante sus últimas reservas de alimento, de pronto encuentra un filón de oro. Nuestra alegría por haber escapado de una vida de frustraciones no tenía límites. Papá cree que ha encontrado algo mejor que el oro. Durante un cierto tiempo estará tentado a acariciar este tesoro y a guardarlo para él solo. No verá de inmediato que, de hecho, sólo ha desenterrado la pequeña punta de un venero inagotable y que este filón le reportará dividendos solamente si continúa cavando el resto de su vida y cediendo indefectiblemente todo el producto a los demás.
      Si la familia coopera, papá advertirá muy pronto que él está sufriendo una distorsión de valores. Entenderá que su crecimiento espiritual peca de unilateral; que, para un hombre medio como él, una vida espiritual que no incluya los propios deberes familiares puede, a fin de cuentas, no ser tan perfecta. Si la familia comprende que el comportamiento actual del padre no es más que una fase de su crecimiento, todo se resolverá bien. En un clima familiar de comprensión y simpatía, el neófito de la espiritualidad pondrá fin prontamente a sus fantasías espirituales.
      Pero esto es lo que puede ocurrir si la familia condena al padre y lo critica: después de varios años en los que, a causa de su alcoholismo, papá creyó que sacaba la peor parte en cada enfrentamiento, ahora siente que, con Dios de su lado, él está encima de los demás. Si la familia persiste en criticarlo, él se confortará con este sentimiento de superioridad. Más que tratar a su familia como debiera, el padre se retraerá aun más y se sentirá espiritualmente justificado para actuar de esta manera.
      Aunque los miembros de la familia no aprueben completamente las actividades espirituales del padre, más vale que lo dejen actuar a su modo. Y aun si él demuestra un cierto grado de negligencia y de irresponsabilidad, es recomendable dejarlo actuar como desee a favor de otros alcohólicos. En sus primeros días de convalecencia alcohólica, no hay mejor garantía para que se mantenga sin beber. Aun cuando algunos de sus comportamientos son alarmantes y desagradables, creemos que este punto de partida es más seguro que si él pusiera el éxito profesional o financiero antes que el progreso espiritual. Así será menos proclive a volver a beber, y eso vale más que cualquier otra cosa.
      Los que estuvimos mucho tiempo en el mundo de la fantasía espiritual, hemos terminado por ver nuestro carácter pueril. Este mundo de sueños ha dado lugar a un deseo profundo de ser útil, acompañado de una conciencia siempre más viva de la presencia de Dios en nuestras vidas. Dios, hemos llegado a creer, quiere que pongamos la cabeza cerca de Él, pero que mantengamos firmemente nuestros pies sobre el suelo. Aquí es donde se encuentran nuestros compañeros de viaje y donde debemos hacer nuestro trabajo. Aquí es donde se encuentra nuestra realidad. No hay nada incompatible entre una experiencia espiritual intensa y una vida sana y feliz, encaminada a convertirnos en personas útiles.
      Otra sugerencia: ya sea que los miembros de la familia tengan o no convicciones espirituales, harían bien en examinar los principios que el alcohólico trata de poner en práctica. No podrán desaprobar estos preceptos simples, aun si el jefe de la casa no los aplica a la perfección. Nada ayudará más al hombre lanzado sobre la vía espiritual que ver a su esposa adoptar un buen programa de espiritualidad y vivirlo mejor que él.
      Otros cambios profundos van a producirse en la casa. Como el alcohol debilitó al papá durante muchos años, la madre se convirtió en jefa de la familia. Ella asumió valientemente esta responsabilidad. Las circunstancias la forzaron a tratar al padre como a una persona enferma o como a un niño caprichoso. Aun cuando éste quería hacer valer su autoridad, no podía porque el hecho de beber lo ponía constantemente del lado del error. Era la madre la que cumplía con la tarea de planificar y dirigir todo. Cuando no bebía, el padre generalmente obedecía. Así, sin que nunca lo hubiese querido, la madre se habituó a llevar los pantalones en la casa. Pero de repente el padre renace a la vida y quiere hacerse valer. Habrá problemas a menos que los miembros de la familia repriman la tendencia a dominar de ambas partes, y se llegue a un mutuo entendimiento amigable.
      El alcoholismo aísla del resto del mundo a la mayoría de los hogares que toca. El padre quizás hizo a un lado durante años toda actividad normal, como su participación en clubes sociales o asociaciones de ciudadanos, o aun la práctica de un deporte. Al mostrar nuevamente interés en estas ocupaciones, puede suscitar un sentimiento de celos. La familia piensa que tiene a papá hipotecado y que, por lo tanto, no puede haber ningún beneficio para los demás derivado de tal hipoteca. En vez de participar ellos mismos en actividades nuevas, la madre y los hijos le exigen al padre una presencia casi permanente en casa, a fin de recuperar el tiempo perdido.
      Desde el mismo comienzo, la pareja debe hacerse a la idea de que alguien tiene que ceder algo si se pretende que la familia desempeñe un papel eficaz en la nueva vida que se anuncia. El padre pasará necesariamente mucho tiempo con otros alcohólicos, pero esta actividad deberá estar equilibrada. Puede entablar amistad con personas no alcohólicas y considerar con atención sus intereses. Los problemas de la comunidad también exigirán su atención. Aunque la familia no tenga contactos religiosos, quizá sus miembros deseen establecerlos con algún grupo y aun convertirse en miembros de él.
      Estas relaciones podrían aportar mucho a los alcohólicos que se burlaran de aquéllos que tuviesen convicciones religiosas. A causa de su experiencia espiritual, el alcohólico descubrirá que tiene mucho en común con estos hombres y mujeres, aun cuando no coincidan en varios puntos. Si no se pone a discutir de religión, hará nuevos amigos y encontrará ciertamente nuevas formas de ser útil y de distraerse. Él y su familia pueden tomar un lugar importante en el seno de estas agrupaciones. El alcohólico restablecido puede renovar la esperanza y el coraje de sacerdotes, ministros o rabinos, los cuales consagran lo mejor de ellos mismos a nuestro mundo turbulento. Nosotros proponemos lo anterior a título de sugerencia y no como obligación. No pertenecemos a ninguna religión; no buscamos decidir por otros acerca de ese tema. Le toca a cada quien actuar, haciéndole caso a su propia conciencia.
      Hasta este punto hemos tratado cosas serias, a veces incluso trágicas. Tratamos sobre el alcohol en sus peores aspectos. Sin embargo, no somos tristes ni melancólicos. Si los recién llegados no encontrasen ninguna alegría ni buen humor en nuestra existencia, no querrían una igual para ellos. Nosotros estamos plenamente convencidos de que hay que disfrutar la vida. Tratamos de no regodearnos en el cinismo ante la situación mundial ni de llevar sobre nuestros hombros los pecados del mundo. En cuanto vemos que alguien se atasca en el fango del alcoholismo, le prodigamos los primeros auxilios y ponemos nuestros recursos a su disposición. Por él aceptamos con todo gusto volver a relatar y a vivir, por así decirlo, los horrores de nuestro pasado. Pero aquellos de nosotros que han intentado echar sobre sus hombros las penas de los demás, han sido aplastados por ellas.
      Creemos entonces que la risa y la alegría pueden ser de una gran utilidad. Las personas del exterior a veces se escandalizan cuando estallamos en risas por el recuerdo de una experiencia pasada, en apariencia trágica. ¿Y por qué debíamos de privarnos de reír? Estamos ahora restablecidos y hemos sido dotados con el poder de ayudar a los demás.
      Todo el mundo sabe que casi nunca se ríen las personas con mala salud y las que raramente se divierten. Dejemos entonces a los miembros de cada familia divertirse entre ellos, o separadamente, en tanto las circunstancias lo permitan. Estamos seguros de que Dios nos quiere dichosos, felices y libres. No podemos adherirnos a la idea de que la vida es un valle de lágrimas, aunque así lo haya sido en una ocasión para muchos de nosotros. Pero es evidente que hemos sido nosotros los causantes de nuestra propia miseria. Esta no es la obra de Dios. No inventemos la desdicha y saquemos provecho de los problemas cuando lleguen, regocijándonos de la ocasión que se nos dé para demostrar toda Su omnipotencia.
      Hablemos ahora de la salud. Un cuerpo que ha padecido las graves heridas del alcohol no se restablece de la noche a la mañana, ni tampoco el pensamiento torcido y la depresión desaparecen en un parpadeo. Estamos convencidos de que un modo de vida espiritual es el remedio más poderoso para recuperar la salud. Para nosotros, que estamos restablecidos de un problema grave de alcohol, la salud mental es un verdadero milagro. Pero también hemos visto cambios extraordinarios en nuestros cuerpos. Es difícil que alguno de los nuestros muestre ahora algún signo de la disipación pasada.
      ￼
      Esto no quiere decir que no tengamos en cuenta los medios de curación puestos a nuestra disposición. Dios ha provisto generosamente a este mundo de buenos médicos, psicólogos y especialistas de toda clase. No dude en confiar sus problemas de salud a estos profesionales. La mayoría de ellos se consagra a fin de que sus pacientes puedan tener una mente y un cuerpo sanos. Trate de recordar que, aunque Dios ha realizado milagros entre nosotros, no debemos subestimar a un buen médico o a un buen psiquiatra. Sus servicios son a menudo indispensables para tratar a un recién llegado y para seguir sucesivamente su caso.
      Uno de los numerosos médicos que tuvieron la ocasión de leer este libro en su forma manuscrita, nos decía que comer caramelos podría ayudar a menudo al paciente, siempre y cuando el médico diese su aprobación. Según él, todos los alcohólicos deberían tener chocolates al alcance de la mano, en razón de su aporte inmediato de energía en los momentos de fatiga. Agregaba que los caramelos eran recomendables para calmar la sensación de vacío que los alcohólicos experimentan ocasionalmente en las noches. Muchos hemos descubierto que nos gustan los alimentos dulces y que nos ayudan.
      Una palabra sobre las relaciones sexuales. Para ciertos hombres, el alcohol se revela como un estimulante, de modo que llos abusan en este sentido. Hay parejas que se sienten consternadas al descubrir que el alcohólico que cesa de beber ahora da señales de impotencia sexual. A menos que se comprenda la razón de esto, el hombre puede estar emocionalmente abrumado por este problema. Algunos de nosotros hemos vivido esta experiencia, sólo para disfrutar después de algunos meses una intimidad aun más hermosa. No se debe titubear para consultar a un médico o a un psicólogo si la situación persiste. Hasta donde sabemos, existen pocos casos en que el problema haya durado mucho tiempo.
      El alcohólico puede encontrar dificultad en restablecer relaciones amigables con sus hijos. Su joven imaginación fue afectada mientras él bebía. Sin que lo digan, podría ser que detestaran a su padre por lo que les hizo a ellos y a su madre. Los niños son a veces capaces de una dureza y un escepticismo patéticos. Se muestran incapaces de perdonar y de olvidar. Esto puede durar meses y terminar mucho tiempo después que su madre haya aceptado el nuevo modo de vida y la nueva forma de pensar del padre.
      Pero a la larga ellos comprenderán que su padre es un hombre nuevo y, a su manera, se lo harán saber. Y cuando esto se produzca, ellos podrían ser invitados a unirse a la meditación de la mañana y a tomar parte en la diaria plática, sin rencor y sin tomar partido. A partir de ese momento, el progreso será rápido. Estos reencuentros dan a menudo resultados maravillosos.
      Independientemente de que la familia acepte o no vivir sobre una base espiritual, el alcohólico deberá hacerlo si quiere restablecerse. Falta que los demás puedan creer, sin sombra de duda, en su nueva orientación. Para la mayoría de los miembros de una familia que ha vivido con un alcohólico, ver es creer.
      A propósito, aquí está un caso. Uno de nuestros amigos era un fumador y bebedor de café empedernido. No hay duda de que su consumo era excesivo. Deseosa de ayudarlo, su esposa comenzó a reprochárselo. Él reconoció que exageraba, pero decía que no estaba dispuesto a dejar de hacerlo. Su esposa, que era de las que encuentran algo anormal en estas prácticas, se puso a hostigarlo a tal punto que su intolerancia acabó por provocarle un acceso de cólera. Se emborrachó.
      Es cierto: nuestro amigo estaba equivocado, totalmente equivocado. Debió admitirlo dolorosamente y se puso a restablecer sus relaciones personales con Dios y con su esposa. Aunque hoy es un miembro muy activo de Alcohólicos Anónimos, aún fuma y bebe café; sin embargo, ni su mujer ni nadie lo juzga por esto. La esposa, a su vez, también debió admitir que había hecho mal en insistir en dicho asunto, cuando su marido se restablecía rápidamente de males mucho más graves.
      Para este propósito tenemos tres dichos, que son: „PRIMERO LO PRIMERO”,       „VIVE Y DEJA VIVIR” y       „POCO A POCO SE VA LEJOS”.

    - A LOS EMPLEADORES
    - |
      Entre los numerosos empleadores que conocemos, pensamos en uno de nuestros miembros que ha pasado una gran parte de su vida en el mundo de las grandes empresas. Él ha contratado y despedido a centenares de hombres. Conoce al alcohólico como puede conocerlo un empleador. Su punto de vista actual debería revelarse como excepcionalmente útil a todos los empresarios.
      Pero, dejémosle la palabra:
      En un tiempo yo era subdirector de una empresa que ocupaba a seiscientos sesenta empleados. Un día, mi secretaria me anunció que el señor B. insistía en hablarme por teléfono. Le di instrucciones de contestarle que no me interesaba hablar con él. Ya varias veces le había advertido a este empleado que no le quedaba más que una oportunidad. Poco tiempo después me telefoneó dos días seguidos desde Hartford, en un estado de ebriedad tal que a duras penas podía hablar. Le dije que ahora sí estaba despedido, y para siempre.
      Mi secretaria regresó a decirme que el señor B. no era quien estaba al teléfono, sino su hermano, y que éste tenía un recado para mí. Yo esperaba una petición de clemencia, pero esto fue lo que escuché del otro extremo de la línea: „Quería decirle solamente que Paul se arrojó desde una ventana de un Hotel en Hartford el sábado último. Dejó una nota diciendo que usted era el mejor patrón que jamás hubiese tenido, y que usted no era responsable en absoluto de lo sucedido.”
      En otra ocasión, al abrir una carta que estaba sobre mi escritorio, se escapó un recorte de periódico: se trataba del obituario de uno de los mejores vendedores que yo jamás hubiese tenido a mi servicio. Después de beber durante quince días, activó con el dedo del pie el gatillo de una escopeta cuyo cañón se había puesto dentro de la boca. Yo lo había despedido seis semanas atrás a causa de su alcoholismo.
      He aquí un último ejemplo. Una voz de mujer me hablaba débilmente a través del teléfono, desde Virginia. Ella quería saber si la póliza de seguro de vida de su marido estaba aún vigent. Cuatro días antes él se había colgado en su cabaña de caza. Debido a que bebía, me vi obligado a despedirlo, a pesar de su inteligencia y de su dinamismo; era uno de los mejores organizadores que yo hubiese conocido.
      He aquí a tres hombres excepcionales que el mundo perdió porque yo no conocía el alcoholismo como ahora lo conozco. Para colmo de la ironía, ¡yo mismo me convertí en un alcohólico! Y sin la intervención de una persona que me ha comprendido, quizá yo hubiese seguido su camino. Mi caída ha costado al mundo de los negocios no se sabe cuantos miles de dólares, ya que se necesita mucho dinero para preparar a un hombre destinado a un puesto de alta dirección. Este tipo de desperdicio jamás se recupera. Según nosotros, el mundo de los negocios está afectado por una situación que podría mejorarse con una mejor y general comprensión.
      Casi todos los empleadores modernos sienten una responsabilidad moral por el bienestar de su personal y tratan de hacer frente a tal responsabilidad. Se comprende fácilmente por qué jamás la han sentido por los alcohólicos. A los ojos del patrón, el alcohólico es un tonto de primer orden. Quizá debido al particular talento del empleado o al afecto personal del empleador, a menudo éste ha conservado en su puesto al alcohólico mucho más tiempo de lo que hubiera sido razonable. Algunos empleadores han recurrido a cada uno de los remedios conocidos. Sólo en pocos casos ha habido falta de paciencia y de tolerancia. Y nosotros, que hemos abusado de los mejores empleadores, difícilmente podríamos reprocharles que hubiesen sido bruscos.
      Este es un ejemplo típico: un director de una de las más grandes instituciones bancarias de los Estados Unidos de América sabe que ya no bebo. Un día me habló de un dirigente del mismo banco que, partiendo del retrato que me hizo de él, era sin ninguna duda un alcohólico. Vi en ello la oportunidad de servir y entonces, durante dos horas, le hablé sobre esta enfermedad, describiéndole los síntomas y las consecuencias lo mejor que pude. Su comentario fue: „Muy interesante, pero estoy seguro de que este hombre ha resuelto su problema de alcohol. Acaba de regresar de una licencia de tres meses, siguió una cura de desintoxicación, parece estar en forma y, en conclusión, el consejo de administración le ha dicho que ésta es su última oportunidad.”
      Yo solamente pude responder que si ese hombre seguía el modelo usual, recaería más gravemente que nunca. Eso, pensaba yo, era inevitable, y me preguntaba si el banco no estaría actuando de manera injusta con él. ¿Por qué no ponerlo en contacto con algún miembro alcohólico de uno de nuestros grupos? Quizá tuviese una oportunidad de salir del problema. Le destaqué el hecho de que yo no había ingerido una gota de alcohol desde hacía tres años, a pesar de las dificultades que hubieran empujado a nueve hombres entre diez a emborracharse. ¿Por qué no ofrecerle la oportunidad de escuchar mi propia experiencia? „Oh, no”, dijo mi amigo. „Este hombre o termina con el alcohol o se quedará sin trabajo. Si tiene tu fuerza de voluntad y tu carácter, va a triunfar y a salir.”
      Yo hubiese querido gritar mi desánimo, puesto que veía que no había podido lograr que mi amigo banquero comprendiese. Simplemente, él no podía creer que su colega del consejo sufría una grave enfermedad. No había nada que hacer más que esperar.
      El hombre en cuestión efectivamente recayó y perdió su empleo. Nos pusimos en contacto con él después de su despido. Sin dificultad aceptó los principios y el método que nos habían ayudado a nosotros. No tengo ninguna duda de que él se está restableciendo. Para mí, este incidente ilustra la incomprensión que se tiene del sufrimiento del alcohólico y la ignorancia de los empleadores en cuanto al papel que ellos podrían desempeñar en el restablecimiento de sus empleados atacados por esta enfermedad.
      Si usted desea ayudar a algún alcohólico, haría bien en no tomar en cuenta su propia manera de beber o de no beber. Ya sea que usted sea un bebedor fuerte, un bebedor moderado o un abstemio, puede tener opiniones muy radicales y quizás hasta prejuicios al respecto. Si usted bebe moderadamente, quizá le fastidien más los alcohólicos que a aquellas personas que no beben en absoluto. El hecho de beber ocasionalmente y comprender sus propias reacciones le proporciona una seguridad hacia tantas cosas que no tienen necesariamente los alcohólicos. Si bebe moderadamente, puede beber o no beber, a voluntad. Usted puede controlar su manera de beber cuando lo desee.
      ￼
      Si una noche se sobrepasa, podrá levantarse en la mañana, sacudir su cabeza e ir a atender sus ocupaciones. Para usted, el alcohol no es verdaderamente un problema. No puede comprender que lo pueda ser para alguien más, a menos que sea una persona sin voluntad o un estúpido.
      Una vez que trate con un alcohólico, puede sentirse, y es algo natural, fastidiado por su debilidad, su estupidez y su irresponsabilidad. Aun aquéllos que comprendan esta enfermedad pueden reaccionar de esta manera.
      Observar actuar a un alcohólico en su empresa puede serle útil. ¿Acaso este alcohólico no es habitualmente brillante, de mente ágil, lleno de imaginación y simpático? Cuando está sobrio, ¿no trabaja duro y no tiene el don de hacer que las cosas salgan adelante? Si él tuviera estas cualidades y no bebiera, ¿valdría la pena que permaneciera en su empresa? ¿Debe tenerle la misma consideración que a los demás empleados con mala salud? ¿Vale la pena que se salve? Si su respuesta es sí, entonces las sugerencias que siguen podrían serle útiles, ya sea que sus motivos sean humanitarios o de negocios.
      ¿Se siente capaz de abandonar la sensación de que tiene que enfrentarse con hábitos pésimos, con una forma de obstinación y con una débil voluntad? Si esto le parece difícil, vale la pena que relea los capítulos segundo y tercero de este libro, donde se ha explicado en forma amplia la enfermedad del alcoholismo. Como hombre de negocios, usted necesita conocer la realidadantes de tomar en consideración los eventuales resultados. Si usted admite que su empleado está enfermo, ¿podrá perdonarle todos las cosas absurdas que ha hecho en el pasado? ¿Puede creer que él ha sido víctima de una manera de pensar aberrante, causada directamente por la acción del alcohol en su cerebro?
      Recuerdo muy bien mi sorpresa cuando un eminente médico de Chicago me habló de casos en los que la presión del líquido raquídeo había provocado lesiones cerebrales. ¡Cómo entonces asombrarse de que un alcohólico sea irracional! ¿Quién no lo estaría con un cerebro febril como el de él? Los bebedores normales no conocen estas alteraciones, ni pueden comprender las aberraciones del alcohólico.
      Su empleado probablemente ha tratado de esconder muchas de sus historias más embarazosas. Puede que sean bastante serias, hasta repugnantes. Usted podría perderse al tratar de comprender cómo un individuo así de leal en apariencia pudo actuar de ese modo. Mas sus enredos, sin importar lo graves que sean, generalmente pueden ser imputados a la acción anormal del alcohol en su mente. Cuando bebe o sale de una borrachera, un alcohólico, que a veces es un modelo de honestidad cuando está en un estado normal, cometerá cosas increíbles. En seguida, su horror por lo que ha hecho será terrible. Casi siempre, estos extravíos no son achacables más que a su ebriedad.
      No se trata aquí de creer que todos los alcohólicos son honestos y se comportan correctamente cuando no beben. Naturalmente que no es así. Estas personas pueden aprovecharse de usted. Al darse cuenta de su empeño por comprenderlos y ayudarlos, algunos intentarán abusar de su bondad. Si usted está seguro de que su hombre no quiere dejar de beber, lo mejor es despedirlo, y cuanto antes, mejor. No le hace ningún servicio conservándolo en su empleo. El despido podría ser una bendición para un individuo así; podría ser exactamente la „patada“ que tanto necesita. Personalmente, yo sé que mi empresa no hubiera podido hacer nada para que yo cesara de beber, ya que, mientras conservé mi empleo, no pude darme cuenta hasta qué punto era grave mi situación. Si me hubieran despedido antes y enseguida hubieran hecho lo adecuado para ofrecerme la solución contenida en este libro, habría podido retornar con ellos seis meses después, ya restablecido.
      Pero hay muchos hombres que quieren dejar de beber, y usted podría llegar lejos con ellos. La comprensión que usted les brinde en su tratamiento le reportará beneficios.
      Quizás usted tenga en mente a un hombre como éste: él quiere dejar de beber y usted quiere ayudarlo, aunque sólo sea con un fin utilitario, ya que es un buen elemento. Usted ahora sabe más sobre el alcoholismo. Se da cuenta de que él está mental y físicamente enfermo. Usted se muestra dispuesto a olvidar sus pasados errores. Supongamos que decidiese abordarlo de la siguiente manera:
      Usted le dice que está al corriente de su condición de alcohólico y que ella debe cesar. Puede decirle que reconoce su talento, que le gustaría conservarlo como empleado, pero que no podrá hacerlo si sigue bebiendo. Una actitud firme en este punto ha ayudado a muchos de nosotros.
      Sucesivamente podrá asegurarle que no tiene la intención de amonestarlo, de moralizarlo o de condenarlo; y que si esto ocurrió anteriormente fue por su escaso conocimiento en la materia. Si es posible, no muestre ningún resentimiento tenaz hacia él. En este punto sería bueno explicarle qué cosa es el alcoholismo: una enfermedad. Dígale que usted lo considera una persona gravemente enferma y pregúntele si, en vista de lo enfermo que está, desea restablecerse. Mencione la razón por la cual le pregunta si desea recuperarse: muchos alcohólicos que están intoxicados tienen la mente torcida y no quieren renunciar al alcohol. ¿Y él querrá dejar de beber? ¿Hará todo lo que sea necesario? ¿Se someterá a todo lo que sea necesario para dejar de beber definitivamente?
      Si dice que sí, entonces continúe usted: ¿está verdaderamente decidido o en s fuero interno cree poder burlarse de usted al proponerse tomar una copa de cuando en cuando, después de haber descansado? Según nosotros, es importante sondear al sujeto profundamente sobre estos puntos. Asegúrese de que él no trata de engañarlo ni de engañarse a sí mismo.
      Nosotros le dejamos tomar la decisión de mencionar o no nuestro libro. Si el empleado sólo contemporiza con usted y cree aún poder seguir bebiendo, aunque no sea más que cerveza, será bueno despedirlo después de la próxima borrachera, la cual no tardará en llegar si es un alcohólico. Debe comprender absolutamente bien este hecho. El hombre que está ante usted quiere y puede restablecerse, o bien, ni quiere ni puede. En este caso último, no pierda su tiempo con él. Este consejo puede parecer muy duro y severo, pero habitualmente es lo mejor que se puede hacer.
      Después de haberse asegurado de que su hombre quiere recuperarse y de que intentará todo medio para lograrlo, usted podrá sugerirle un plan preciso de acción. Para la mayor parte de los alcohólicos que beben o que apenas han superado una borrachera, es deseable y a veces imperativo la recuperación a través de un tratamiento médico. Con toda seguridad, este aspecto del tratamiento debería ponerse en manos de su propio médico. Cualquiera que sea el tratamiento, el fin es suprimir los efectos del alcohol en la mente y el cuerpo del alcohólico. Esta desintoxicación raramente dura mucho tiempo o cuesta mucho cuando es llevada a cabo por personas competentes. Su hombre se restablecerá más rápido si adquiere una condición física que le permita pensar verdaderamente y anular la sed alcohólica. Si usted le propone este método, es posible que tenga que darle un adelanto para pagar el costo del tratamiento. También es importante que comprenda que todo gasto será deducido ulteriormente de su sueldo. Es mucho mejor que su empleado se sienta enteramente responsable de su restablecimiento.
      Si acepta su oferta, será necesario subrayar que el tratamiento físico es sólo una pequeña parte del método de recuperación. Aunque usted le procurase los mejores cuidados médicos posibles, él debe comprender que es necesario experimentar un cambio dentro de sí. Para librarse del alcohol se requiere modificar la actitud, así como la forma de pensar. Agregue que cada uno de nosotros debió colocar su curación antes que cualquier otra cosa, puesto que, sin restablecimiento, hubiésemos perdido todo, hogar y trabajo.
      Pregúntele si usted puede tener enteramente confianza en su capacidad para restablecerse. ¿Y usted se siente capaz de garantizarle que el tema será estrictamente privado, de modo que sus desdichas de alcohólico y el tratamiento que deberá afrontar no se tocarán sin su permiso en conversaciones? Sería bueno tener una larga plática con él a su regreso.
      Retornemos al argumento de este libro: éste contiene numerosas sugerencias concretas que van dirigidas al empleado deseoso de solucionar su problema de alcohol. Algunas de las ideas que contiene son nuevas para usted. Quizás usted no se sienta muy atraído por el método que le sugerimos. Lejos está de nosotros la intención de ofrecerlo como la última palabra. Sin embargo, en lo que a nosotros concierne, este método ha sido eficaz. Después de todo, ¿no son los resultados más importantes que los medios para llegar a los mismos? Aunque no le guste, su empleado descubrirá la trágica verdad sobre el alcoholismo. Aunque él no esté convencido de la utilidad del remedio, éste no podrá hacerle daño.
      Le sugerimos atraer sobre este libro la atención del médico que asistirá a su paciente durante el tratamiento. Si el paciente puede leerlo mientras padece una profunda depresión, será más capaz de hacer conciencia de su propia situación.
      Es de esperarse que el médico le revele al paciente la verdad sobre su estado, cualquiera que sea. Cuando se le dé el libro al paciente, es preferible no decirle que se tiene que apegar a las sugerencias ahí puestas. La decisión debe tomarla él.
      Quizás usted apueste a que su propio cambio de actitud y el contenido de este libro corregirán el problema de alcohol de su empleado. En ciertos casos sí ocurre esto; en otros, no. Sin embargo, creemos que, si persevera, usted se verá recompensado por el éxito. Dado que nuestra actividad se difunde y el número de los nuestros aumenta, esperamos que sus empleados podrán ponerse en contacto con un miembro de nuestro grupo. Entretanto, tenemos la certeza de que un buen tramo del camino puede recorrerse poniendo en práctica los consejos de este libro.
      Una vez que su empleado regrese de su tratamiento, hable con él. Pregúntele si cree tener la solución. Si se siente libre de discutir su problema con usted; si sabe que usted lo comprende y que usted no se molestará por lo que él desea decirle, el comienzo será excelente.
      En tales circunstancias, ¿usted se siente capaz de permanecer sereno si él comienza a decirle cosas desagradables? El podrá revelarle, por ejemplo, que ha inflado la cuenta de sus gastos o que tenía en mente apropiarse de varios de sus mejores clientes. De hecho, podrá decirle cualquier cosa desde el momento en que él aceptó nuestra solución, la cual, como usted sabe, requiere una rigurosa honestidad. ¿Se siente usted capaz de olvidar todo el pasado como si se tratase de una cuenta incobrable y de recomenzar con él? Si le debe a usted dinero, podría fijarle condiciones favorables.
      Si le habla de su situación familiar, sin duda podría darle sugerencias oportunas. ¿Puede hablar francamente con usted siempre y cuando no revele secretos de negocios o critique a sus colegas? Con este tipo de empleado, una actitud así inspirará una lealtad perenne.
      Los más grandes enemigos de nosotros los alcohólicos son el resentimiento, los celos, la envidia, la frustración y el miedo. Por doquier, donde los hombres se reúnen con motivos de trabajo, hay rivalidad y de esa rivalidad nacen ciertas intrigas de oficina. Nosotros tenemos a menudo la impresión de que las personas tratan de despreciarnos. A menudo no ocurre eso, en absoluto. Mas sí puede ocurrir que nuestro alcoholismo les sirva como „capital político” a otros.
      Nos viene a la mente el caso de un individuo malicioso que constantemente hacía pequeñas bromas acerca de las vicisitudes de un colega alcohólico. De tal modo que ponía a circular chismes mordaces. Otro caso es el de un alcohólico que fue hospitalizado para recibir tratamiento. Al principio, sólo algunos de sus compañeros de trabajo estaban al corriente de su hospitalización, pero en poco tiempo la cosa era ya del dominio público en toda la empresa. Naturalmente, en un contexto tal el empleado tenía muchas menos probabilidades de restablecerse. El empleador muchas veces puede proteger a la víctima de tales chismes. Él no puede hacer favoritismo, pero siempre puede defender a un hombre de inútiles provocaciones y de críticas injustas.
      Los alcohólicos son personas enérgicas. Ellos trabajan duro y despliegan una gran actividad. Su empleado sin duda está dispuesto a desplegar todo su esfuerzo en sus labores. Habiendo sido debilitado y encarado con el reajuste físico y mental a una vida que no conoce el alcohol, quizá podría pecar de exceso de celo en su trabajo. Usted podría llegar a tener que frenar su deseo de trabajar dieciséis horas diarias. Quizá sea necesario animarlo a que ocasionalmente se divierta. Podrá darse el caso que durante sus horas de trabajo desee hacer cualquier cosa por ayudar a otros alcohólicos. Una razonable libertad de movimiento le sería de mucha ayuda. Para permanecer abstemio, este hombre tiene necesidad de este tipo de ocupación.
      Una vez que su hombre haya pasado varios meses sin beber, usted podrá utilizar sus servicios en favor de otros empleados alcohólicos siempre que, naturalmente, estén dispuestos a aceptar la intervención de un tercero en su situación. Un alcohólico que se ha restablecido, pero que ocupa un puesto relativamente poco importante, puede hablarle a un hombre con una posición más elevada. Viviendo sobre una base totalmente diferente, jamás se aprovechará de la situación.
      Usted puede tener confianza en este empleado. La larga experiencia con las infinitas coartadas del alcohólico lleva naturalmente a la sospecha. Cuando su mujer le telefonee para decirle que él está enfermo, usted podrá llegar a la inmediata conclusión de que está borracho. Si este es el caso y tiene aún el deseo de restablecerse, él se lo dirá a usted, incluso si esto implica la pérdida de su puesto. Porque él sabe que debe ser honesto si quiere sobrevivir. Él apreciará que usted no se rompa la cabeza por su situación, que no tenga sospechas de él, que no intente tenerlo al abrigo de la tentación de beber. Si él sigue concienzudamente el programa de restablecimiento, podrá ir a donde los negocios de usted lo llamen.
      En caso de que dé un nuevo paso en falso, aunque sea una sola vez, usted decidirá si lo despide o no. Si está seguro de que no se ha empeñado en forma seria, no hay duda de que debe despedirlo. Si, por el contrario, está seguro de que él está dando lo mejor de sí, puede ofrecerle una última oportunidad. Sin embargo, usted no debe sentirse obligado a conservarlo en su puesto, ya que ha hecho lo que le correspondía.
      Hay otra cosa que usted puede hacer. Si su empresa es de grandes dimensiones, podría darles este libro a los jóvenes ejecutivos y hacerles saber que usted no tiene ninguna aversión por los alcohólicos en su empresa. Estos jóvenes están a menudo en una posición difícil. Los hombres que tienen a sus órdenes son a menudo sus amigos. Así, por una razón u otra, estos jóvenes ejecutivos protegen a sus subordinados, esperando que las cosas se arreglen. A menudo ponen sus propios puestos en peligro al tratar de ayudar a los bebedores que debieron haber sido despedidos desde hace mucho tiempo o a los cuales se les debió haber ofrecido la oportunidad de restablecerse.
      Después de leer este libro, el joven ejecutivo podrá abordar a un empleado y decirle algo así como: „Escucha, mi amigo: ¿quieres dejar de beber o no? Me pones en aprietos siempre que te emborrachas. Es injusto para mí y es injusto para la compañía. He aprendido algunas cosas sobre alcoholismo. Si eres un alcohólico, estás gravemente enfermo. De hecho, te comportas como tal. La compañía desea ayudarte para que te restablezcas y, si la cosa te interesa, hay una forma de que salgas. Si aceptas este método, tu pasado será olvidado y el hecho de ausentarte para que te traten no será mencionado. Pero si no puedes ni quieres dejar de beber, creo que será mejor que renuncies.”
      El joven director en cuestión puede no estar de acuerdo con el contenido de nuestro libro. No es necesario que lo muestre a su probable alcohólico y a menudo es mejor no hacerlo. Pero al menos comprenderá el problema y no se dejará engañar más por las promesas habituales. Estará en una mejor posición para actuar con ese hombre, en una posición eminentemente clara y justa. Ya no tendrá razón para cubrir a un empleado alcohólico.
      Esto quiere decir, en resumen, que ningún empleado debe ser despedido simplemente porque es un alcohólico. Si él quiere cesar de beber, se le debería dar realmente la oportunidad de hacerlo. Si no puede o no quiere renunciar al alcohol, él debe ser despedido. Las excepciones a esta regla son raras.
      Según nosotros, el método propuesto permitirá realizar varias cosas. Les dará a los hombres de valía la oportunidad de restablecerse. Al mismo tiempo, le permitirá a usted no tener ninguna duda para librarse de aquéllos que no puedan o no quieran cesar de beber. Quizás el alcoholismo le esté causando graves daños a su empresa por las pérdidas de tiempo, dinero y prestigio que entraña. Esperamos que nuestras sugerencias lo ayuden a remediar las graves fugas. Pensamos que actuamos razonablemente al reiterarle que ponga fin a este desperdicio y le ofrezca, a quien la merezca, la posibilidad de recuperarse.
      El otro día visitamos al vicepresidente de una gran empresa industrial para informarle sobre nuestro método. Escuche lo que nos dijo: „Estoy muy feliz de que ustedes hayan tenido éxito en superar su problema de alcohol. Sin embargo, la política de nuestra empresa es la de no intervenir en la vida privada de los empleados. Si un hombre bebe en tal forma que afecte su trabajo, lo despedimos. No veo de qué modo nos pueden ayudar, pues — como pueden verlo — no tenemos ningún problema de alcoholismo.” Anualmente, esta misma empresa dedica millones para investigación. Sus costos de producción son muy bajos. El personal dispone de instalaciones recreativas y tiene seguros. La empresa se ocupa realmente del bienestar de sus empleados, tanto por razones humanitarias como por su propio interés, pero del alcoholismo no, pues simplemente no cree que éste exista dentro de sus muros.
      Quizá se trate de una actitud típica. Nosotros que, como grupo, tenemos un buen conocimiento del mundo de los negocios, por lo menos desde el punto de vista del alcoholismo, no pudimos hacer otra cosa más que sonreír al escuchar la sincera opinión de este hombre de bien. Probablemente se asombraría si conociese cuánto cuesta cada año el alcoholismo a su organización. Esta empresa tiene, sin duda, varios alcohólicos activos o en potencia. Consideramos que los directores de grandes empresas a menudo no tienen más que una vaga idea de la magnitud del problema que existe dentro de las mismas. Aunque usted crea que el problema no está dentro de su empresa, le convendría verlo más de cerca. Quizás hiciese interesantes descubrimientos.
      Este capítulo presenta a los alcohólicos, personas enfermas, trastornadas. Los alcohólicos que nuestro amigo tenía en mente eran los bebedores normales o fiesteros. Para ellos, su política era sin ninguna duda sensata, pero no hacía ninguna distinción entre los bebedores y los alcohólicos.
      No es necesario creer que a un empleado alcohólico se le debe consagrar mucho tiempo y atenciones exageradas. Él no debe gozar de un tratamiento preferencial. El individuo justo, aquel que se recupera, no aceptará una situación tal de privilegio. No abusará. Todo lo contrario, trabajará como desesperado y le estará agradecido hasta el último de sus días.
      Actualmente tengo una compañía pequeña. Entre los empleados hay dos alcohólicos cuyo rendimiento laboral equivale al de cinco vendedores normales. ¿Y por qué es así? Ellos tienen una nueva actitud hacia la vida y se han salvado de ser muertos en vida. Para mí es motivo de constante alegría haberme empeñado en ayudarlos a recuperarse.

    - LA VIDA QUE LE ESPERA
    - |
      Para la mayoría de las personas normales, el alcohol es sinónimo de convivencia, de camaradería y de sueños dichosos y coloridos. Tomar una copa los libera del fastidio y de la preocupación. Es la intimidad gozosa con los amigos y la sensación de que la vida es hermosa. Mas no fue así en los últimos días de nuestro exagerado consumo. Los placeres de ayer se habían desvanecido. Ya no eran más que recuerdos. Nunca jamás pudimos revivir los momentos de intensa alegría del pasado. Nos dominaba un deseo compulsivo de disfrutar la vida como antes y estábamos obsesionados por el pensamiento de que, gracias a un renovado milagro, pudiésemos retomar el control de nosotros mismos y cumplir ese deseo. Sin embargo, cada nuevo intento desembocaba en un fracaso.
      Mientras menos nos toleraban las personas, más nos retirábamos de la sociedad; de la vida misma. A medida que nos sujetábamos aun más a Su Majestad el alcohol, la bruma glacial de la soledad se abatía sobre nosotros, ciudadanos temblorosos de su reino demente, más y más espesa, más y más negra. Algunos de nosotros buscábamos los lugares sórdidos, esperando encontrar en ellos compañías que comprendieran, que aprobaran. Momentáneamente lo lográbamos, y después la locura y el horrible despertar para enfrentar a los espantosos cuatro caballeros del Apocalipsis: El Terror, el Aturdimiento, la Frustración, la Desesperación. ¡Los infelices bebedores que lean esta página lo comprenderán bastante bien!
      En uno de sus pocos momentos de abstinencia, un gran bebedor dirá: „No me hace falta para nada el alcohol. Me siento mejor. Trabajo mejor. La paso mejor.” Como antiguos bebedores problema, sonreímos al escuchar esta declaración. Sabemos que nuestro amigo es como el niño que silba en la obscuridad para darse valor. Él se engaña. Dentro de sí piensa que daría cualquier cosa por poderse tomar media docena de cervezas con la certeza de salir indemne. Todavía intenta el viejo juego, porque no está satisfecho con su sobriedad. No puede imaginarse una vida sin alcohol. Llegará el día en que no podrá imaginar la vida, sea con alcohol o sin él. Y ese día conocerá entonces una soledad como muy pocas personas la han conocido. Se encontrará al borde del precipicio. Deseará el fin.
      Hemos relatado la forma en que fuimos salvados. Sin duda, usted piensa: „Sí. Sí quisiera. Pero, ¿deberé resignarme a llevar una vida en la que siempre tendré el mismo aspecto estúpido, fastidioso y triste que he reconocido en algunas personas virtuosas? Sé que debo vivir sin alcohol, pero, ¿cómo hacerlo? ¿Tienen acaso algo satisfactorio que ofrecerme a cambio?”
      Sí, y algo mucho más que eso: se trata de formar parte de la Agrupación de Alcohólicos Anónimos. Allí encontrará usted un alivio a la tensión, al aburrimiento y a la inquietud. Su imaginación será estimulada. La vida finalmente tendrá un significado para usted. Están frente a usted los años más satisfactorios de su existencia. Esto lo hemos encontrado en nuestra Agrupación y esto lo encontrará usted también.
      „¿Cómo podrá ocurrir todo esto? ”, se preguntará usted. „¿Dónde encontraré a estas personas?”
      Encontrará usted estos nuevos amigos en la ciudad en que vive. Muy cerca de usted hay alcohólicos que están muriendo, sin auxilio, como los náufragos de una nave que se está hundiendo. Si usted habita en un lugar grande, ahí los encontrará por centenas. Ricos o pobres, de clase social elevada o baja, ellos son los futuros miembros de Alcohólicos Anónimos. Entre ellos, algunos se convertirán en amigos para toda la vida. Se crearán entre ustedes lazos nuevos y maravillosos, pues juntos escaparán del desastre y, hombro con hombro, emprenderán el mismo viaje. Entonces comprenderá usted qué cosa significa dar algo de usted para que otros puedan sobrevivir y volver a descubrir la vida. Aprenderá el pleno significado de estas palabras: „Amarás a tu prójimo como a ti mismo.”
      Puede parecer increíble que estos hombres puedan volver a ser felices, respetables y útiles. ¿Cómo han podido salir de una miseria tal, de tal deshonor y de una situación tan desesperada? No hay que buscar muy lejos la respuesta a esta pregunta; debido a que tales cosas han sucedido entre nosotros, pueden repetirse para usted. Si las desea sobre cualquier otra cosa y está dispuesto a hacer uso de nuestra experiencia, estamos seguros de que lo que le hemos dicho ocurrirá. La era de los milagros aún está vigente. Nuestro mismo restablecimiento lo prueba.
      Esperamos que cuando este modesto libro sea lanzado sobre la marea mundial del alcoholismo, los bebedores derrotados se asirán de él para seguir sus sugerencias. Muchos, estamos seguros, se pondrán de pie y empezarán a caminar. Ellos avisarán a otros individuos enfermos, y grupos de Alcohólicos Anónimos surgirán en toda ciudad y en todo pueblo, y serán un refugio para aquellos que tienen que encontrar una salida.
      En el capítulo „Trabajando con otros”, usted se dio una idea de nuestro modo de acercarnos y ayudar a los demás a recuperar la salud. Supongamos ahora que, gracias a usted, varias familias han adoptado nuestro modo de vida. Usted querrá saber cómo proceder a partir de ese momento. Quizá la mejor forma de darse una idea sobre su futuro sea describirle cómo ha crecido nuestra Agrupación. He aquí una breve reseña:
      Hace casi cuatro años, en 1935, uno de los nuestros hizo un viaje a una ciudad del oeste de los Estados Unidos. Desde el punto de vista de negocios, este viaje terminó como un fracaso. Si hubiese tenido éxito en su asunto, hubiera conseguido establecerse financieramente, lo que en esa época era de una gran importancia para él. Pero la empresa terminó en un problema judicial, totalmente empantanada. Este asunto fue para él motivo de muchos rencores y de muchas polémicas.
      Profundamente desanimado, se encontraba él en una ciudad extraña, desacreditado y casi sin dinero. Todavía físicamente débil y sobrio desde hacía sólo unos cuantos meses, comprendió el peligro de su situación. Sentía una urgente necesidad de hablar con alguien. Pero..., ¿con quién?
      La tarde era sombría; él recorría una y otra vez el hall del hotel, preguntándose con qué dinero iba a pagar su cuenta. En un extremo del hotel se encontraba, debajo de un vidrio, la lista de las iglesias locales. Al otro extremo de la estancia, una puerta daba a un bar totalmente atrayente. Pudo ver ahí a una multitud animada y gozosa. Entre estas personas encontraría, sin duda, amigos y solaz. Pero, a menos que bebiera, no tendría el valor para hacer amistad con alguien y pasaría un solitario fin de semana.
      Evidentemente, él no podía beber, pero, ¿por qué no sentarse con buenas esperanzas a una mesa con una botella de refresco enfrente? Después de todo, ¿no había ya renunciado al alcohol desde hacía seis meses? Quizá podría aún permitirse... digamos tres copas. ¡Ni una más! El miedo se apoderó de él. Era como si jugara con fuego. La vieja e insidiosa aberración de la primera copa se apoderó de él otra vez. Se alejó temblando y se dirigió a la lista de iglesias al fondo del hall. El sonido de la música y de voces alegres flotaba aún en el aire y llegaba hasta él.
      ¿Pero, cómo olvidarse de su responsabilidad con su familia y con los hombres que morirían porque no sabían cómo restablecerse, ah sí, los otros alcohólicos? Debían existir muchos en esta ciudad. Le iba a telefonear a un sacerdote. La razón regresó a él. Se lo agradeció a Dios. Escogió una iglesia al azar en la lista, entró en una caseta telefónica y levantó el auricular.
      Su llamada al sacerdote lo condujo a casa de cierta persona, residente en esa ciudad, que — antes capaz y respetada — estaba ahora hundida casi en el fondo de la desesperación a causa del alcoholismo. Su caso era el de costumbre: matrimonio amenazado, esposa enferma, hijos desorientados, cuentas atrasadas y posición social comprometida. Él tenía un deseo desesperado de dejar de beber, pero no veía una salida, pues ya había tratado muchas formas de escape. Dolorosamente consciente de ser de algún modo anormal, no se daba plenamente cuenta de qué cosa significaba ser un alcohólico.
      Una vez que nuestro amigo le contó su experiencia, el hombre admitió que aun cuando ponía toda su voluntad de que era capaz, no podía cesar de beber durante mucho tiempo. Una experiencia espiritual, lo admitía, era absolutamente necesaria, pero la carga le parecía pesada si debía basarse en los principios sugeridos. Él dijo vivir en la inquietud constante de que alguien pudiese descubrir su alcoholismo. Y, obviamente, como todo alcohólico, estaba convencido de que muy pocas personas conocían su estado. ¿Por qué, y ésta era su objeción, debía perder los pacientes que le quedaban y causar aun más sufrimientos a su familia, cometiendo la tontería de declarar su condición enferma? Haría todo, menos eso.
      Todavía con curiosidad, invitó a nuestro amigo a vivir en su casa. Poco tiempo después, y justo cuando él pensaba estar adquiriendo un cierto dominio sobre su alcoholismo, se puso una borrachera magistral. Para él, ésta fue la crisis de todas las crisis. Comprendió que debía afrontar honestamente sus problemas si quería que Dios le diese el dominio sobre todos ellos, incluyendo el alcohol.
      Una mañana agarró al toro por los cuernos y se preparó a decirle a aquellas personas a las que más temía cuál había sido su problema. Con sorpresa se encontró bien acogido y se dio cuenta de que muchos ya sabían que él bebía. Saltó a su coche y fue a visitar a las personas a las que había hecho daño. Temblaba mientras iba de un lado a otro, porque aquello podía significar su ruina, especialmente si se trataba de una persona de su profesión.
      A medianoche regresó a casa exhausto pero muy feliz. Desde entonces no ha bebido una sola copa. Como veremos más adelante, él es desde entonces muy apreciado en su ciudad; los grandes daños causados en treinta años de abuso del alcohol fueron reparados en cuatro años.
      Pero la vida no fue fácil para los dos amigos. Encontraron numerosas dificultades. Juntos comprendieron que debían mantenerse espiritualmente activos. Un día le llamaron por teléfono a la enfermera en jefe del hospital local. Le explicaron que tenían necesidad de ayudar a otros alcohólicos y le preguntaron que si ella tendría entre sus enfermos a un alcohólico confirmado.
      „Sí”, respondió ella. „¡Tenemos una maravilla! Acaba de golpear a dos enfermeras. Pierde la cabeza totalmente cuando bebe. Pero es una buena persona cuando está sobrio, aunque se ha recuperado aquí ocho veces en los últimos seis meses. Creo que él fue en otros tiempos muy conocido como abogado en esta ciudad, pero por el momento está sólidamente inmovilizado.”
      ￼
      Teníamos allí a un verdadero candidato pero aparentemente no era demasiado prometedor. El uso de los principios espirituales en casos como éste no estaba tan bien experimentado como ahora. Pero uno de los dos amigos dijo: „Alójelo en un cuarto privado. Regresaremos.”
      Dos días después, un futuro miembro de Alcohólicos Anónimos observaba con ojos vidriosos a los dos desconocidos que permanecían a los lados de su cama. „¿Quiénes son ustedes y por qué este cuarto privado? Hasta ahora siempre me habían tenido en una sala común.”
      Uno de los visitantes le respondió: „Venimos a tratar su alcoholismo.”
      La desesperación se leyó en letras grandes sobre el rostro del hombre cuando replicó: „Oh, pero si es inútil. No hay nada que se pueda hacer conmigo. Soy un fracaso. Las últimas tres veces me emborraché saliendo de aquí. Tengo miedo de franquear esa puerta. No comprendo nada.”
      Durante una hora, los dos amigos le relataron sus experiencias de alcohólicos. En todo momento, el enfermo repetía: „Así me pasa a mí. Así me pasa a mí. Así me pongo cuando bebo.”
      Él supo que sufría una especie de envenenamiento grave, que esta afección deterioraba su organismo y le destruía la mente. Y se habló largamente del estado de ánimo que precedía la primera copa.
      „Sí, sí, me ha psado a mí,” decía el hombre enfermo, „exactamente como a ustedes. Ustedes dos saben de qué hablan. Sólo que yo no veo de qué pueda servir. Ustedes son hombres respetables. Yo también fui así, pero ahora ya no soy nada. Luego de escucharlos hablar, estoy más convencido que nunca de mi incapacidad para dejar de beber.” Los dos visitantes comenzaron a reír. El futuro miembro de A A replicó: „No veo que haya algo chistoso en esto.”
      Los dos amigos hablaron de su experiencia espiritual y le explicaron qué cosa trataban de hacerle comprender.
      Él los interrumpió diciendo: „Yo era muy asiduo a la iglesia, pero no funcionó. Recé tanto a Dios en esas horribles mañanas, cuando me atormentaba el dolor de cabeza, juré y volví a jurar que no volvería a tomar una sola gota más, pero a las nueve de la mañana ya estaba ahogado nuevamente.”
      ￼
      Al día siguiente encontramos a nuestro amigo más dispuesto a escuchar. Él había reflexionado al respecto. „Quizá tengan razón,” dijo. „Diosuede realizar cualquier milagro.” Después agregó: „La certeza que tengo es que no hizo gran cosa por mí cuando trataba de luchar yo solo contra esta juerga alcohólica.”
      Al tercer día, el abogado puso su vida al cuidado de su Creador y se declaró completamente dispuesto a hacer cualquier cosa que fuera necesaria. Su mujer vino a su encuentro sin casi atreverse a tener esperanza, aunque encontró algo diferente en el marido. Él había comenzado ya su experiencia espiritual.
      Esa misma tarde se vistió y dejó el hospital; era un hombre libre. Se involucró en una campaña electoral, hizo discursos, frecuentó toda clase de lugares, quedándose a veces de pie toda la noche. Perdió por un pequeño margen. Sin embargo, había encontrado a Dios y, al descubrir a Dios, se había encontrado a sí mismo.
      Esto ocurrió en junio de 1935. Desde entonces, él no ha vuelto a beber una copa. También se ha convertido en un miembro útil y respetable de su comunidad. Ha ayudado a otros hombres a restablecerse y  un miembro influyente de la iglesia, de la cual se había alejado por tanto tiempo.
      Había entonces tres alcohólicos en esta ciudad que hoy comprenden que deben ofrecer a otros lo que ellos descubrieron, o si no perecen. Después de haber fracasado varias veces en su búsqueda de otros candidatos, descubrieron a un cuarto. Este último llegó por medio de un conocido que había escuchado la buena nueva. Se trataba de un joven disoluto cuyos padres no acertaban a entender si quería o no dejar de beber. Su rechazo de todo lo que se relacionara con la iglesia trastornaba grandemente a sus padres, los cuales eran profundamente religiosos. Este joven hombre sufría horriblemente con sus borracheras, pero aparentemente no se podía hacer nada por él. Estuvo de acuerdo en internarse en el hospital, donde fue colocado en la misma habitación que anteriormente había ocupado el abogado.
      Recibió a tres visitantes. Poco después de su llegada, él les dijo: „La manera en que presentaron estos sucesos espiritualeses sensata. Estoy dispuesto a salir adelante con ustedes. Creo que, después de todo, mis viejos tenían razón.” Así fue como un nuevo miembro se unió a la Agrupación.
      Durante todo este tiempo, nuestro amigo del hall del hotel se había quedado en aquella ciudad. Ahí permaneció tres meses. Después regresó a su casa, dejando tras de sí a su primer conocido, al abogado y al joven disoluto. Estos hombres habían encontrado un nuevo interés en la vida. Aunque estaban conscientes de que tenían que ayudar a otros alcohólicos si querían permanecer sobrios, esta motivación de la abstinencia se colocó en segundo plano. Fue superada por la dicha que experimentaban al consagrarse a otros. Compartieron su hogar, sus magros recursos y fueron dichosos al consagrar su tiempo libre a los miembros que sufrían. De noche como de día estaban dispuestos a hacer hospitalizar a algún nuevo caso y, además, a visitarlo. El número de miembros aumentó. Hubo algunos fracasos que los confundieron pero, en estos casos, hicieron un esfuerzo por llevar a la familia del alcohólico a un modo de vida espiritual, aliviando así grandemente su angustia y sufrimiento.
      Al cabo de un año seis meses, los tres pioneros habían logrado reunir a siete nuevos miembros. Se frecuentaban mucho y raramente pasaba una noche sin que hubiera, en casa de uno o del otro, una pequeña reunión de hombres y mujeres dichosos de haber sido liberados y constantemente en busca de dar a conocer su descubrimiento a algún nuevo. Además de encontrarse así, sin formalidad, tomaron la costumbre de reservar una noche de la semana para dedicarla a una reunión dirigida a cualquiera que se interesara en un modo de vida espiritual. El fin principal de estas calurosas reuniones abiertas era darles a los recién llegados una ocasión y un lugar para hablar sobre sus problemas.
      Personas del exterior se interesaron en la causa del alcoholismo. Un hombre y su mujer pusieron su enorme casa a disposición de este heterogéneo grupo. Más tarde, esta pareja se entusiasmó tanto con nuestra obra que nos consagró su casa para nuestro restablecimiento. Numerosas fueron las mujeres desorientadas que vinieron a encontrar la compañía de mujeres comprensivas y calurosas, informadas sobre el problema, y para escuchar de boca de maridos salvados cómo habían vivido la experiencia; ellas venían a buscar consejo sobre las providencias que debían tomar para que su marido se hospitalizara y para que en su próxima recaída recibiese información por parte de otros alcohólicos ya restablecidos.
      Muchos hombres, aún temblorosos por la experiencia de recuperación en el hospital, han recobrado su libertad al franquear el portón de esta casa. Más de un alcohólico, después de haber entrado, sale con una solución a su problema, queda seducido por la alegría que reinaba en el interior, por las personas que reían de sus propias desgracias, pero que comprendían las de él. Impresionado por aquéllos que le habían hecho visitas en el hospital, él candidato capitulaba totalmente cuando, en una habitación del último piso de la casa, escuchaba a un hombre cuya experiencia correspondía con la suya. La expresión en los rostros de las mujeres, ese algo indefinible en los ojos de los hombres, el ambiente estimulante y electrizante del medio, todo concurría para convencerlo de que al final había encontrado un refugio.
      La manera tan práctica de abordar los problemas de alguien, la ausencia de toda intolerancia y formalidad, la auténtica democracia, la sorprendente comprensión con que estas personas daban testimonio eran irresistibles. El alcohólico y su mujer salían de esta casa embargados por el pensamiento de lo que ellos podrían hacer de ahí en adelante para ayudar a un alcohólico de su medio y su familia. Sabían que tenían una multitud de amigos; tenían la impresión de que conocían a esos extraños desde siempre. Habían sido testigos de milagros y era en ellos donde ahora el milagro se iba a operar. Tuvieron una visión de la Gran Realidad, de su Creador, bueno y todopoderoso.
      El día de hoy, esta casa apenas se da abasto para recibir a todos los visitantes cada semana, regularmente entre sesenta y ochenta. Los alcohólicos que son atraídos proceden de todos los lugares, tanto cercanos como lejanos. De las ciudades circunvecinas, las familias cubren una buena distancia para llegar ahí en coche. Una comunidad localizada a treinta millas de ahí cuenta con quince miembros de Alcohólicos Anónimos. Como se trata de una gran ciudad, creemos que la Agrupación alguna día deberá tener ahí centenas de miembros.
      Sin embargo, la vida de Alcohólicos Anónimos es más que asistir a reuniones e ir al hospital. Cada día se trata de reparar antiguas penas, de ayudar a componer diferencias familiares, de hacer que el hijo pródigo sea comprendido por sus furiosos padres, de prestar dinero y de ayudar a encontrar trabajo en caso de necesidad, eso forma parte de nuestra vida cotidiana. Ninguno está tan desacreditado o tan hundido como para negarle una calurosa recepción, siempre que sea sincero. Las distinciones sociales, las pequeñas rivalidades y los celos, todo eso nos hace reír mucho. Al principio náufragos de un mismo barco, después rehabilitados y unificados bajo un mismo Dios y deseosos de consagrar cuerpo y alma por el bien de otros, nuestros miembros no encuentran mucho interés en las cosas que cuentan tanto para otras personas. ¿Cómo podría ser de otro modo?
      En condiciones que apenas difieren, el mismo escenario se desarrolla en diferentes ciudades del este del país. En una de estas ciudades se encuentra un hospital afamado por su tratamiento de alcohólicos y drogadictos. Hace seis años, uno de nuestros miembros ingresó al mismo. Varios de nosotros sentimos, por vez primera, la presencia y la fuerza de Dios en el interior de los muros de este establecimiento. Le debemos mucho al médico responsable de la buena marcha de este hospital, pues, aunque nuestra presencia pudo comprometer su situación, él nos dijo que creía en nuestro método.
      Casi todos los días, este médico nos sugiere que nos acerquemos a cualquiera de sus pacientes. Como él comprende lo que nosotros hacemos, está en posición de seleccionar a los que estén dispuestos a restablecerse sobre una base espiritual. Muchos de nosotros que fuimos pacientes de este hospital, regresamos ahí para ofrecerles ayuda. Además, en esta ciudad del este hay reuniones informales, como las descritas anteriormente y donde usted podrá encontrar a treinta o cuarenta de nosotros. Ahí se ven nacer las mismas amistades espontáneas y se encuentra la misma disposición de ayuda entre nosotros, tal como ocurre con nuestros amigos del oeste del país. Nuestros miembros viajan mucho de un lado al otro del país para aportar su ayuda, y nosotros prevemos un fuerte aumento de membresía debido a estos intercambios.
      Tenemos la esperanza de que un día todos los alcohólicos que viajen encuentren grupos de Alcohólicos Anónimos a donde vayan. Hasta cierto punto esto ya se está realizando, como lo pueden testificar nuestros amigos dedicados a las ventas. Pequeños grupos de dos, tres o cinco miembros han surgido en ciertas poblaciones, gracias a las comunicaciones establecidas con nuestros dos centros más grandes. Aquéllos de nosotros que viajan, se detienen en estas poblaciones tan seguido como pueden hacerlo. Así es como podemos dar una mano a estos grupos y, de la misma manera, escapar a las tentaciones de las que todo viajero puede platicarle.
      Es así como hemos crecido. Y usted también podrá crecer aunque esté solo, con sólo el libro como equipaje. Creemos y tenemos la esperanza de que el libro contenga todo lo que usted necesite para que se sitúe sobre la vía de la recuperación.
      Sabemos lo que piensa. Usted se dice: „Estoy solo y tengo miedo. Soy incapaz de hacerlo.” Sin embargo, usted lo puede hacer. Se olvida de que acaba de descubrir una fuente de fuerza muy superior a usted mismo. Hacer todo lo que hemos logrado, con un apoyo tal, no es más que una cuestión de buena voluntad, paciencia y trabajo.
      Tomemos el caso de un miembro de A A que vivía en una gran ciudad. Habitaba ahí desde hacía pocas semanas cuando descubrió que el lugar contenía más alcohólicos por kilómetro cuadrado que cualquier otra ciudad del país. Esto ocurrió sólo unos pocos días antes que se escribieran estas líneas (1939). La situación causaba mucha inquietud a las autoridades locales. Nuestro amigo entró en contacto con un eminente psiquiatra que había tomado algunas iniciativas para la salud mental de la ciudadanía. Este médico era una persona muy capaz y estaba extraordinariamente ansioso por adoptar cualquier método que pudiera mejorar la situación. Entonces le preguntó a nuestro amigo acerca de lo que éste tenía que ofrecer.
      Nuestro amigo le expuso nuestro método, con un éxito tal que el médico aceptó hacer un ensayo con sus enfermos y con algunos otros alcohólicos de la clínica donde él practicaba. Sucesivamente se celebraron acuerdos con el psiquiatra en jefe de un gran hospital público, a fin de seleccionar a otros enfermos entre la corriente de miserables que circulaba por el establecimiento.
      Así, nuestro compañero trabajador pronto tendrá amigos en abundancia. Algunos de ellos quizá se hundan para nunca levantarse, pero si nuestra experiencia puede servir de medida, más de la mitad de los que reciban nuestro mensaje se convertirán en miembros de Alcohólicos Anónimos. Cuando en esa ciudad pocos hombres se hayan reencontrado a sí mismos y hayan descubierto la dicha de ayudar a los demás a afrontar de nuevo la vida, el proceso continuará hasta que cada enfermo haya tenido una oportunidad de restablecerse, a condición de que sea capaz de hacerlo y lo desee.
      Quizás usted todavía diga: „Pero no tendré la oportunidad de entrar en contacto con ustedes, los autores de este libro.” No podemos decirlo con certeza. Dios decidirá al respecto. Debe recordar que es siempre en Él en quien usted verdaderamente debe confiar. Él le mostrará cómo crear la confraternidad que usted tanto desea.
      Nuestro libro no tiene más intención que presentarle sugerencias a usted. Nos damos cuenta de que sabemos pocas cosas. Dios nos revelará más tanto a usted como a nosotros. En su meditación matinal pregúntele qué puede hacer usted cada día en favor del que aún sufre. Las respuestas vendrán, si el orden reina dentro de usted. Porque, evidentemente, usted no podrá transmitir algo que no tenga. Asegúrese de que sus relaciones con Él sean buenas y grandes cosas se producirán para usted y para un número incalculable de personas. Para nosotros, ésta es la Gran Verdad.
      Abandónese a Dios tal como usted Lo conciba. Reconozca sus faltas ante Él y ante sus compañeros de viaje. Limpie los escombros de su pasado. Done libremente aquello que se le ha donado y únase a nosotros. Nosotros estaremos con usted en la Fraternidad del Espíritu y sin duda que encontrará a algunos de nosotros mientras marcha valerosamente sobre el camino del Feliz Destino.
      ¡Qué Dios lo cuide y lo bendiga!

    - L’HISTOIRE DE BILL
    - |
      LA fièvre de la guerre était grande dans la petite ville de Nouvelle-Angleterre où, jeunes officiers frais émoulus de Plattsburg, nous avions été canton- nés. Comme nous étions flattés lorsque les notables nous ouvraient la porte de leur maison, nous donnant le sentiment d’être des héros ! Tout chantait l’amour, le triomphe, la guerre ; moments sublimes ponctués d’intervalles des plus joyeux. Enfin je participais à la vie et, au milieu de l’allégresse, j’ai découvert l’al- cool pour la première fois. J’avais oublié les sévères mises en garde et les préjugés de ma famille au sujet de l’alcool. Le moment venu, nous nous sommes embarqués pour « là-bas... outre-mer ». Comme je m’ennuyais beaucoup, je me suis de nouveau tourné vers l’alcool.
      Nous avons débarqué en Angleterre. J’ai visité la cathédrale de Winchester. Très ému, je suis allé me promener. Mon attention fut attirée par une épitaphe gravée sur une vieille pierre tombale :
      Ci-gît un grenadier du Hampshire Qui passa de vie à trépas Parce qu’il buvait trop de bière. On n’oublie pas un bon soldat Qu’il meure par le mousquet Ou par le pichet.
      C’était là un sinistre avertissement que je n’ai pas su prendre au sérieux.
      Lorsque je suis enfin rentré au pays, à vingt-deux ans, j’étais déjà un vétéran des guerres à l’étranger. Je croyais enmesqualitésdechef :leshommesdemonbataillonne m’avaient-ils pas donné un témoignage spécial d’appré- ciation ?Mesaptitudesdemeneurmehisseraient–jeme plaisais à le croire – à la tête de vastes entreprises que je dirigerais avec la plus grande assurance.
      J’ai suivi un cours du soir en droit et par la suite, j’ai décroché un emploi comme inspecteur dans une société de cautionnement. La course à la réussite était commen- cée. J’allais prouver au monde entier que j’étais quel- qu’un. Mon travail m’a amené à Wall Street et, peu à peu, je me suis intéressé au marché des valeurs. Beaucoup y perdaient de l’argent, mais d’autres y faisaient fortune. Pourquoipasmoi ?J’aiétudiél’économieetlessciences commerciales en plus du droit. En raison de mon pen- chant pour l’alcool, j’ai failli échouer à mon cours de droit. Je me suis présenté à l’un des derniers examens trop ivre pour écrire ou même penser. Même si je ne buvais pas encore de façon continue, ma femme s’inquiétait. Nous avions de longues conversations au cours des- quelles je tentais de la rassurer en lui disant que les hommes de génie avaient eu leurs meilleures idées sous l’effet de l’alcool... que les plus sublimes théories philo- sophiques étaient nées de la même façon.
      À la fin de mon cours de droit, je savais déjà que je n’étais pas fait pour cette discipline. J’étais envoûté par le tourbillon de Wall Street. Les bonzes de la finance et du monde des affaires étaient mes héros. Mêlant alcool et spéculation, j’ai commencé à forger l’arme qui un jour se retournerait contre moi, comme un boomerang, etme réduirait en pièces. En rédui-
      sant nos dépenses, ma femme et moi avions écono- misé 1000 dollars. Cet argent a servi à acheter des titres alors bon marché et peu recherchés. J’avais pensé, avec raison, que ces titres prendraient beau- coup de valeur un jour. Je n’avais pas réussi à convaincre mes amis de la bourse de m’envoyer exa- miner la gestion d’usines et d’entreprises, mais j’ai décidé avec ma femme d’y aller quand même. J’avais développé la théorie voulant que la plupart des gens perdaient de l’argent à la bourse à cause de leur igno- rance des marchés. Plus tard, j’allais découvrir beau- coup d’autres raisons.
      Nous avons quitté nos emplois pour partir à l’aven- ture sur une motocyclette dont nous avions chargé le side-car d’une tente, de couvertures, de vêtements de rechange et de trois énormes annuaires de références boursières. Nos amis nous disaient fous à lier. Ils avaient peut-être raison. Grâce à quelques spéculations heureuses, nous avions un peu d’argent de côté, mais il nous est arrivé une fois de devoir travailler dans une ferme pendant un mois pour éviter de puiser dans notre petit capital. Je n’allais pas connaître avant fort long- temps un autre travail manuel honnête. En une année, nous avons couvert tout l’Est des États-Unis. Les rap- ports que j’avais envoyés à Wall Street pendant ce temps m’ont valu à notre retour un poste associé à un compte de frais. Cette année-là, l’exercice d’un droit d’option a donné lieu à des rentrées de fonds supplé- mentaires qui se sont traduites par un profit de plu- sieurs milliers de dollars.
      Au cours des quelques années qui ont suivi, la chance m’a apporté argent et honneurs. J’avais réussi. Nom- breux étaient ceux qui adoptaient mes idées et se fiaient à mon jugement dans cette ronde des millions sur papier.
      La grande vague de prospérité de la fin des années vingt déferlait sur le monde économique. Prendre un verre était devenu une chose importante pour moi et mettait du piquant dans ma vie. En ville, on parlait haut et fort dans les boîtes de jazz. On dépensait des milliers et on parlait en millions. Les railleurs pouvaient bien se moquer et aller au diable. Je m’étais fait une foule d’amis des beaux jours.
      Ma consommation d’alcool a augmenté sérieuse- ment. Je buvais continuellement le jour et presque tous les soirs. Les remontrances de mes amis dégénéraient en disputes et je me suis retrouvé tel un loup solitai- re. Il y a eu de nombreuses scènes malheureuses dans notre somptueux appartement. Je n’avais jamais été réellement infidèle à ma femme car ma loyauté envers elle, parfois aidée par mon état extrême d’ébriété, me gardait de ces ennuis.
      En 1929, j’ai eu la fièvre du golf. Nous nous sommes aussitôt installés à la campagne où ma femme m’applaudissait pendant que je tentais de surpasser les exploits de Walter Hagen. L’alcool a cependant pris le dessus plus vite que je n’ai pu rattraper Wal- ter. J’ai commencé à être saisi de tremblements le matin. Le golf constituait une occasion de boire tous les jours et tous les soirs. Je prenais plaisir à évoluer sur le parcours du club sélect qui m’avait tant impres- sionné lorsque j’étais jeune. J’affichais le magnifique bronzage des biens nantis. Le banquier de la localité me regardait déposer et encaisser de gros chèques avec un scepticisme amusé.
      Puis, en octobre 1929, brusquement, l’enfer s’est déchaîné à la bourse de New York. À la fin d’une de ces journées infernales, je passais en titubant du bar d’un hôtel à un bureau de courtage. Il était huit heures, la bourse avait fermé ses portes cinq heures plus tôt. Le télégraphe fonctionnait encore. Je fixais un bout de papier sur lequel était inscrit XYZ-32. Le matin du même jour, ce titre cotait à 52. J’étais ruiné et plusieurs de mes amis aussi. Les journaux rappor- taient que des hommes s’étaient suicidés en se jetant du haut des tours de la bourse. Cela me révoltait. Moi, je ne me suiciderais pas. Je suis retourné au bar. Mes amis avaient perdu plusieurs millions depuis dix heures le matin. Et alors ? Demain était un autre jour. Tout en buvant, je me suis senti envahi à nou- veau par la même détermination féroce de gagner que j’avais autrefois.
      Le lendemain matin, j’ai téléphoné à un ami de Montréal. Il lui restait encore beaucoup d’argent. Il croyait que je ferais mieux d’aller m’installer au Cana- da. Le printemps suivant, ma femme et moi avions repris notre train de vie habituel. Je me sentais comme Napoléon au retour de l’île d’Elbe. Pas d’île Sainte- Hélène pour moi ! Mais l’alcool m’ayant rattrapé, mon généreux ami fut contraint de se séparer de moi. Cette fois, nous allions rester sans argent.
      Nous sommes allés vivre chez les parents de ma femme. J’ai trouvé un emploi que j’ai perdu par la suite à cause d’une querelle avec un chauffeur de taxi. Heureusement, personne ne pouvait deviner que pendant cinq ans, j’allais demeurer sans emploi véri- table et ne pas me dégriser un seul instant. Ma femme avait trouvé du travail dans un grand magasin et quand elle rentrait à la maison épuisée, elle me trou- vait soûl. Chez les courtiers, où je traînais, j’étais devenu un indésirable.
      L’alcool n’était désormais plus un luxe mais une nécessité. Deux et parfois trois bouteilles de gin de contrebande par jour avaient fini par constituer ma ration coutumière. De temps en temps, une petite tran- saction me rapportait quelques centaines de dollars ; j’acquittais alors mes dettes dans les bars et les casse- croûte. Le même manège se répétait sans cesse et j’ai commencé à m’éveiller très tôt le matin, secoué de vio- lents tremblements. Il me fallait boire au moins un grand verre de gin et six bouteilles de bière avant d’être en mesure de prendre mon petit déjeuner. Néanmoins, je demeurais convaincu de pouvoir maîtriser la situa- tion et je traversais des périodes de sobriété qui redon- naient espoir à ma femme.
      Les choses se sont détériorées peu à peu. Le créancier hypothécaire a saisi la maison, ma belle-mère est morte, ma femme et mon beau-père sont tombés malades.
      C’est alors qu’une affaire prometteuse s’est présen- tée. Les actions étaient à leur plus bas niveau pour l’an- née 1932 et j’avais réussi tant bien que mal à former un groupe d’acheteurs. Je devais toucher une part géné- reuse des profits. Une cuite magistrale m’a fait perdre cette occasion.
      Ce coup m’a ouvert les yeux. Il fallait que ça cesse. Je me suis rendu compte que je ne pouvais plus prendre même un seul verre. J’en avais fini pour toujours. Jusque-là, j’avais fait quantité de belles promesses, mais ma femme a senti, tout heureuse, que j’étais vrai- ment sérieux cette fois. Effectivement, je l’étais.
      Peu de temps après, je suis rentré ivre à la maison. Je n’avais même pas résisté. Qu’était-il donc arrivé de ma grande résolution ? Je n’en avais pas la moindre idée. Je n’y avais même pas pensé. Quelqu’un m’avait tendu un verre et, tout bonnement, je l’avais pris. Étais- je fou ? Je commençais à me le demander ; tant d’in- conséquence me semblait frôler la démence.
      J’ai renouvelé ma résolution et j’ai essayé de nou- veau. Après un certain temps, la confiance que j’avais acquise a commencé à faire place à la présomption. Je pouvais tourner le dos aux bars et à l’alcool. J’avais désormais ce qu’il fallait ! Un jour, je suis entré dans un café pour téléphoner. En un rien de temps, j’étais au bar, martelant le comptoir en me demandant com- ment c’était arrivé. À mesure que le whisky me mon- tait à la tête, je me disais que je m’en tirerais mieux la prochaine fois mais que pour l’instant, il valait mieux prendre un bon coup. Ce que j’ai fait.
      Je ne pourrai jamais oublier le remords, l’horreur et le désespoir que j’ai ressentis aux premières lueurs du jour. Le courage de combattre n’y éit tout sim- plement pas. Je n’arrivais pas à mettre de l’ordre dans ma tête agitée et j’avais le sentiment terrible d’une catastrophe imminente. Il faisait à peine jour. Je n’osais traverser la rue de peur de m’effondrer et d’être écrasé par un camion. Je suis entré dans un établissement ouvert toute la nuit pour y boire une douzaine de verres de bière. Mes nerfs crispés se sont enfin calmés. En lisant le journal du matin, j’ai appris que le marché avait encore une fois coulé à pic. Comme moi. Le marché s’en remettrait, mais pas moi. Cette pensée m’a fait mal. Me suicider ? Non, pas maintenant. Puis, mon esprit s’est embrouillé et alourdi. Un gin arrangerait les choses. Alors, j’ai pris deux bouteilles et... tout est tombé dans l’oubli.
      Le corps et l’esprit sont de merveilleuses machines car les miens ont résisté à cette agonie pendant deux autres années. Parfois, lorsque la terreur et la folie du matin s’emparaient de moi, je volais de l’argent dans le maigre porte-monnaie de ma femme. Puis, étourdi et vacillant, j’allais à la fenêtre ouverte ou jusqu’à l’armoire à pharmacie où était rangé du poi- son et là, je me traitais de poule mouillée. Ma femme et moi faisions des aller et retour de la ville à la campagne pour chercher à fuir cette situation. Un soir, la torture physique et mentale est devenue si atroce que j’ai eu peur de sauter par la fenêtre. Pour échapper à la tentation, j’ai traîné tant bien que mal mon matelas jusqu’à l’étage inférieur. Un médecin est venu m’administrer de puissants sédatifs. Le len- demain, je mêlais gin et sédatifs. Ce cocktail eut vite fait de me terrasser. On craignait pour ma santé men- tale. Moi de même. Lorsque je buvais, je ne man- geais rien ou presque rien et j’étais quarante livres au-dessous de mon poids normal.
      Grâce à la sollicitude de ma mère et de mon beau- frère médecin, j’ai été admis dans un hôpital reconnu dans tout le pays pour son programme de réhabilita- tion physique et mentale pour alcooliques. Sous les effets d’un traitement à la belladone, mon esprit s’est éclairci. L’hydrothérapie et de légers exercices m’ont aussi fait du bien. Mieux encore, j’ai connu un méde- cin compréhensif : il m’a expliqué que si j’étais incontestablement égoïste et écervelé, j’avais néan- moins été gravement malade, physiquement et men- talement.
      J’ai été quelque peu soulagé d’apprendre que chez les alcooliques, la volonté est étonnamment faible lorsqu’il s’agit de combattre l’alcool alors que, sou- vent, elle est ferme dans d’autres domaines. Je trou- vais enfin une explication à mon comportement incroyablement en désaccord avec mon désir intense de cesser de boire. Comprenant enfin ma condition, je suis parti, plein d’espoir. Pendant trois ou quatre mois, l’ optimisme m’ a donné des ailes. J’ allais en ville régulièrement et j’ai même fait un peu d’argent. La connaissance de soi, voilà où se trouvait sûrement la réponse.
      Ce n’était pas la bonne réponse car le jour terrible est venu où j’ai bu de nouveau. Ma santé morale et physique a coulé à pic. Après un certain temps, je suis retourné à l’hôpital. J’ai eu l’impression que c’était la fin, le tomber de rideau. Ma pauvre femme, exténuée et désespérée, a été prévenue de mon état : j’allais mourir d’une défaillance cardiaque au cours d’une crise de delirium tremens, ou bien devenir un cas d’impré- gnation éthylique peut-être en moins d’un an. Bientôt, elle devrait se résoudre à me confier aux soins des pompes funèbres ou d’un hôpital psychiatrique.
      Personne n’avait besoin de me le dire. Je le savais déjà, et j’en étais presque heureux. C’était un coup mortel porté à mon orgueil. Voilà que moi, qui avais une si haute opinion de moi-même, de mes aptitudes et de ma capacité à surmonter les obstacles, j’étais fina- lement battu. J’allais maintenant plonger dans le noir, me joignant au défilé sans fin des idiots qui étaient déjà passés par là. Je pensais à ma pauvre femme. Nous avions été très heureux malgré tout. Qu’est-ce que je n’aurais pas fait pour me faire pardonner ! Mais il était désormais trop tard.
      Il n’y a pas de mots pour décrire la solitude et le désespoir que j’ai vécus dans l’amère noirceur de l’api- toiement. Je me sentais comme entouré de sables mou- vants. J’avais trouvé un adversaire à ma mesure. J’étais vaincu. L’alcool était devenu mon maître.
      Lorsque j’ai quitté l’hôpital en tremblant, j’étais un homme brisé. La peur m’a empêché de boire un moment. Puis, le jour de l’Armistice en 1934, l’insi- dieuse aberration de ce premier verre m’a repris et encore une fois, j’ai recommencé. Tous s’étaient rési- gnés et acceptaient l’éventualité certaine de mon inter- nement ou de ma fin misérable. Comme il fait noir avant l’aurore ! En fait, je vivais le début de ma der- nière débâcle. J’étais sur le point d’être catapulté dans ce qu’il me plaît d’appeler la quatrième dimension de l’existence. J’allais découvrir le bonheur, la paix et une raison d’être grâce à un mode de vie qui se révèle incroyablement plus merveilleux de jour en jour.
      Un de ces tristes après-midi de la fin de novembre, je prenais un verre, assis dans ma cuisine. J’étais assez content de penser qu’il y avait suffisamment de gin caché dans la maison pour me permettre de passer la nuit et le jour suivant. Ma femme était au travail. Je me demandais si j’oserais cacher une bouteille de gin près de la tête de notre lit. J’en aurais besoin avant le jour.
      Le téléphone a interrompu ma rêverie. D’une voix remplie de bonne humeur, un ancien camarade d’éco- le me demandait s’il pouvait passer me voir. Il était à jeun. Je ne me souvenais pas qu’il soit venu à New York dans cet état depuis des années. J’étais abasour- di. La rumeur avait couru qu’il avait dû être enfermé pour démence alcoolique. Je me demandais comment il avait pu s’en sortir. Bien sûr, il dînerait à la maison et alors je pourrais boire avec lui sans me cacher. Peu soucieux de son bien-être, je pensais seulement à retrouver l’ambiance des jours passés. Un jour, nous avions affrété un avion pour terminer une cuite ! Sa venue me semblait une oasis dans le triste désert de ma vie insignifiante. C’était bien cela, une oasis ! Les buveurs sont ainsi faits.
      Lorsque la porte s’ouvrit, il se tenait là, le teint frais et l’air épanoui. Il avait quelque chose de particulier dans le regard. Il était différent, sans que je puisse expliquer comment. Que s’était-il passé ?
      Je lui ai tendu un verre. Il a refusé. Déçu mais curieux, je me demandais ce qui était arrivé à mon ami. Il n’était pas lui-même.
      « Voyons, qu’est-ce qui se passe ? » ai-je demandé.
      Il m’a regardé droit dans les yeux. Simplement, mais en souriant, il m’a dit : « J’ai trouvé la religion. »
      J’étais horrifié. C’était donc ça : l’été dernier, cin- glé de l’alcool, maintenant, j’en avais bien l’impres- sion, cinglé de la religion. Il y avait de l’émerveillement dans ses yeux. Mon ancien copain s’était bel et bien enflammé pour la religion. Mais je voulais bien le lais- ser discourir ! Et puis mon gin durerait plus longtemps que son sermon.
      Mais il a parlé sans emphase. Posément, il m’a raconté comment deux hommes s’étaient présentés à la cour et avaient persuadé le juge de suspendre sa sentence d’internement. Ils avaient fait mention d’une idée simple fondée sur la religion et d’un programme d’action à mettre en pratique. Cela s’était produit deux mois auparavant, et le résultat était éloquent. Ça marchait !
      Il était venu me faire bénéficier de son expérience, si je le désirais. J’étais renversé, mais la chose m’in- téressait ! Bien sûr qu’elle m’intéressait ! Je ne pou- vais faire autrement car je n’avais plus d’espoir.
      Il a parlé pendant des heur Les souvenirs de mon enfance me revenaient à l’esprit. Il me semblait entendre, comme autrefois lors de paisibles dimanches, le prédica- teur dont la voix me parvenait au loin, sur la colline où j’étais assis ; j’ai pensé au vœu de tempérance que je n’avais jamais prononcé, au mépris bonhomme de mon grand-père pour certaines gens d’Église et leurs agisse- ments ;jemerappelaiscommentmongrand-pèrecroyait à la musique des sphères célestes mais refusait aux prédi- cateurs le droit de lui dire comment l’écouter et son absence de peur alors qu’il parlait de ces choses juste avant de mourir. Tous ces souvenirs refaisaient surface. J’en avais la gorge serrée.
      J’ai repensé à ce jour de la guerre où j’avais visité la cathédrale de Winchester.
      J’avais toujours cru en une Puissance supérieure. J’avais souvent réfléchi à ces choses. Je n’étais pas athée. Peu de gens le sont réellement car l’athéisme implique une foi aveugle dans l’hypothèse étrange que cet unvers est sorti du néant et ne mène nulle part. Mes idoles intellectuelles – les chimistes, les astro- nomes et même les évolutionnistes – supposaient que de grandes lois et de grandes forces régissaient ce monde. En dépit d’indices qui laissaient croire le contraire, il me semblait évident qu’un principe et un ordre puissants sous-tendaient tout cela. Comment pou- vait-il exister tant de lois précises et immuables sans l’intervention d’une forme d’intelligence ? Je ne pou- vais faire autrement que de croire en un Esprit de l’uni- vers, lequel ne connaissait ni temps ni limites. Mais je n’étais pas allé plus loin.
      C’est là que je m’éloignais des ministres du culte et du monde de la religion. Lorsqu’on me parlait d’un Dieu qui m’était personnel, d’un Dieu qui était amour, force surhumaine et guide, je devenais irrité et mon esprit se fermait d’un coup à pareille théorie.
      Au Christ, je concédais la valeur d’un grand homme dont l’exemple était plus ou moins suivi par ceux qui se réclamaient de Lui. Son enseignement moral ? Excellent. Pour ma part, j’en avais retenu les principes qui me semblaient pratiques et qui n’étaient pas trop exigeants ; le reste, je l’écartais.
      Les guerres, les bûchers et les querelles que les luttes religieuses avaient engendrés me dégoûtaient. Je me demandais vraiment si, tout compte fait, les religions de l’humanité avaient quelque chose de bon. À en juger par ce que j’avais vu en Europe et depuis, la puissan- ce de Dieu dans les affaires humaines était négligeable et la fraternité des hommes une sinistre comédie. Si le diable existait, il semblait être le grand patron de la destinée humaine et, chose certaine, il me tenait.
      Mais mon ami, qui restait assis devant moi, a décla- ré de but en blanc que Dieu avait fait pour lui ce qu’il n’avait jamais pu faire pour lui-même. Sa volonté d’hu- main avait échoué. La médecine l’avait déclaré irrécu- pérable. La société s’apprêtait à l’enfermer. Comme moi, il avait admis sa défaite totale. Puis, il était litté- ralement ressuscité des morts, soudainement tiré des bas-fonds pour accéder à une vie meilleure que tout ce qu’il avait connu auparavant !
      Cette force venait-elle de lui ? Non, bien sûr. Il n’y avait pas eu en lui plus de force que je n’en avais en cette minute même, c’est-à-dire absolument aucune.
      J’étais renversé. Je commençais à croire que les gens de religion avaient peut-être raison après tout. Il s’était passé quelque chose dans le cœur d’un homme et cette chose avait réussi l’impossible. Mon opinion sur les miracles a changé sur-le-champ. Finies les opinions d’au- trefois ; un miraculé était là assis en face de moi, de l’autre côté de ma table. Il apportait de grandes nouvelles.
      J’ai constaté que mon ami avait fait plus que mettre de l’ordre dans sa vie intérieure. Il évoluait sur une base différente. Il avait pris racine dans un sol nou- veau.
      ￼
      Malgré cette preuve vivante qu’était mon ami, des restes de vieux préjugés persistaient dans mon esprit. Le mot Dieu soulevait encore en moi une certaine anti- pathie. Mon sentiment de révolte s’est intensifié lorsque fut exprimée l’idée qu’un Dieu existait peut-être pour moi. Ce concept me déplaisait. J’acceptais qu’on parle d’une Intelligence créatrice, d’un Esprit universel ou de l’Âme de la nature, mais je résistais au concept d’un Empereur des cieux, si aimable que puisse être sa domi- nation. Depuis, j’ai parlé à quantité d’hommes qui pen- saient comme moi.
      Mon ami m’a fait une suggestion qui m’a semblé nouvelle. « Pourquoi ne choisis-tu pas ta propre conception de Dieu ? »
      Sa proposition m’a ébranlé. J’ai senti fondre la mon- tagne de glace des préjugés intellectuels dans l’ombre desquels j’avais vécu et tremblé pendant des années. Enfin, je retrouvais la lumière du soleil.
      Il suffisait que j’accepte de croire en une Puissance supérieure à moi-même. Je n’avais riede plus à faire pour commencer. J’ai vu que ce pouvait être le point de départ de la croissance. En adoptant une attitude de complète bonne volonté, je pourrais connaître le chan- gement que je constatais chez mon ami. Pourrais-je y parvenir ? Bien sûr !
      Ainsi, je suis devenu convaincu que Dieu porte atten- tion aux hommes à la condition que ceux-ci le dési- rent suffisamment. Enfin, je voyais, je sentais, je croyais. Mes yeux n’étaient plus obstrués par l’orgueil et les préjugés. Un monde nouveau m’apparaissait.
      J’ai soudain compris la vraie signification de mon expérience dans la cathédrale. L’espace d’un instant, j’avais eu besoin de Dieu et je L’avais désiré. J’avais timidement souhaité qu’Il soit là, et Il était venu. Mais le sentiment de Sa présence avait été rapidement étouf- fé par les clameurs du monde, surtout celles qui s’éle- vaient en moi. Il en avait été ainsi depuis ce temps-là. Comme j’avais été aveugle !
      À l’hôpital, on m’a éloigé de l’alcool pour la der- nière fois. Le traitement semblait indiqué car je mon- trais des signes de delirium tremens.
      Puis, je me suis humblement offert à Dieu tel que je Le concevais alors, Lui demandant de disposer de moi comme Il l’entendait. Je me suis confié à Lui sans réserve pour qu’Il me guide et me protège. Pour la première fois, j’ai admis que seul je n’étais rien ; que sans Lui j’étais perdu. Sans me ménager, j’ai regardé mes fautes en face et consenti à ce que mon tout nouvel Ami les extirpe. Depuis lors, je n’ai plus pris un verre.
      Mon ancien camarade de classe est venu me voir et je lui ai fait part de tous mes problèmes et de tous mes défauts. Nous avons dressé la liste des personnes à qui j’avais causé du tort ou envers qui je nourrissais du ressentiment. Je me suis montré entièrement disposé à rencontrer ces personnes et à admettre mes torts, sans jamais les juger. J’allais redresser tous les torts causés du mieux que je le pouvais.
      Je devais metre à l’épreuve ma nouvelle conscien- ce de la présence de Dieu en moi. Le bon sens serait le contraire de ce qu’il avait été jusqu’à présent. Dans le doute, je devais m’asseoir, tranquille, et demander seulement que me soient données la force et la lumiè- re pour régler mes problèmes de la façon dont Il le voulait. Jamais je ne devais prier pour moi-même, sauf pour demander de devenir plus utile aux autres. Ainsi, seulement, pouvais-je espérer être exaucé. Mais, dans ce cas, je devais l’être abondamment.
      ￼
      Mon ami m’a promis que lorsque j’aurais fait ces démarches, je vivrais un nouveau genre de relations avec mon Créateur ; que j’aurais en mains les éléments d’un mode de vie qui apporterait la solution à tous mes problèmes. Essentiellement, il suffisait de croire en la puissance de Dieu et de se montrer disposé, en toute humilité et en toute honnêteté, à établir et à maintenir ce nouvel ordre des choses.
      C’était simple, mais pas facile ; il fallait y mettr le prix. Cela signifiait l’anéantissement de mon égocen- trisme. Je devais m’en remettre en toutes choses au Père de lumière qui règne sur nous tous.
      Ces propositions étaient radicales et révolutionnaires, mais à partir du moment où je les ai acceptées, l’effet a été électrisant. J’ai éprouvé une impression de victoire suivie d’une sensation de paix et de sérénité que je n’avais jamais ressentie auparavant. J’étais pleinement confiant. Je me sentais transporté, comme si le grand vent frais des cimes avait soufflé à travers moi. La plupart du temps, Dieu vient aux hommes graduellement, mais dans mon cas, la rencontre a été soudaine et profonde.
      Pendant un instant, je me suis senti inquiet ; j’ai appelé mon ami médecin pour lui demander s’il croyait que j’étais encore sain d’esprit. Il écoutait, étonné, ce que je lui racontais.
      Finalement, complètement dépassé, il m’a dit : « Il t’est arrivé quelque chose que je ne comprends pas. Mais tu fais mieux de t’y accrocher. N’importe quoi est mieux que l’état dans lequel tu étais. » Aujour- d’hui, ce bon docteur a souvent l’occasion de rencon- trer des hommes qui vivent des expériences comme la mienne. Il sait qu’elles sont vraies.
      Dans mon lit d’hôpital, la pensée m’est venue qu’il y avait des milliers d’alcooliques désespérés qui seraient heureux de bénéficier de ce qui m’avait été donné de façon aussi gratuite. Je pourrais peut-être en aider quelques-uns. Ils pourraient ensuite intervenir auprès d’autres alcooliques.
      Mon ami avait insisté sur l’absolue nécessité de mettre les principes qu’il m’avait enseignés en pratique dans tous les domaines de ma vie. Il était particuliè- rement important que je m’occupe des autres de la même façon que mon ami l’avait fait pour moi. La foi sans les œuvres est une foi morte, disait-il. Et c’est particulièrement vrai pour un alcoolique ! Car, si un alcoolique néglige d’enrichir et de perfectionner sa vie spiriuelle par son action auprès des autres et par le don de soi, il ne pourra pas survivre aux épreuves et aux dépressions qui le guettent. S’il ne se tenait pas ainsi occupé, l’alcoolique boirait sûrement de nouveau et s’il buvait, il mourrait sûrement. Alors, la foi serait morte en effet. C’est ainsi que nous voyons les choses.
      Ma femme et moi avons adhéré avec enthousiasme à l’idée d’aider d’autres alcooliques à trouver une solu- tion à leurs problèmes. Cette orientation était opportu- ne, car mes anciens partenaires commerciaux ont douté de mon rétablissement pendant un an et demi et j’ai trouvé peu de travail pendant cette période. Je ne me sentais pas très bien à ce moment-là et j’étais tour- menté par des accès d’apitoiement et de ressentiment. Ces sentiments ont parfois failli me ramener à l’alcool mais j’ai vite compris que là où toutes les autres méthodes avaient échoué, l’action auprès d’un autre alcoolique sauvait la situation. Il m’est souvent arrivé de retourner, désespéré, à l’hôpital où j’avais été soi- gné. Là, de parler à un malade me remontait de façon étonnante et je repartais ragaillardi. Ce mode de vie donne des résultats dans les moments difficiles.
      ￼
      Rapidement nous avons commencé à nous faire des amis et un lien fraternel auquel il fait bon appartenir s’est tissé entre nous. La joie de vivre nous habite vrai- ment, même dans les situations de tension ou de dif- ficultés. J’ai vu des centaines de familles s’engager sur des voies prometteuses ; j’ai vu les pires situations familiales redressées, des querelles et des rancunes de toutes sortes effacées. J’ai vu des hommes sortir de l’asile et reprendre une place capitale dans la vie de leur famille et de leur communauté. J’ai vu des membres de professions libérales et des hommes d’af- faires retrouver leur rang social. Il n’y a quasiment aucune forme de problèmes ou de misère qui n’ait été surmontée par nos membres. Une des villes de l’ouest du pays, incluant son agglomération, compte un mil- lier d’alcooliques avec leur famille. Nous nous retrou- vons souvent pour que les nouveaux puissent puiser l’amitié qu’ils cherchent. Ces rencontres informelles réunissent souvent de 50 à 200 personnes. Nous gran- dissons en nombre et en force En 2003, les AA comp- tent plus de 100 000 groupes*.
      Un alcoolique en pleine cuite est un être déplaisant. L’entreprise de persuasion que nous devons engager auprès des alcooliques est parfois éreintante, parfois drôle ou parfois tragique. L’un d’entre eux s’est suici- dé chez moi. Il ne pouvait ou ne voulait pas com- prendre notre mode de vie.
      Nous nous amusons aussi énormément. Peut-être que certaines personnes seraient offusquées par ce qui semble être de la frivolité et un manque de sérieux. Sous ces apparences, nous sommes pourtant d’une gra- vité implacable. La foi doit accomplir son œuvre vingt-

      quatre heures sur vingt-quatre en nous et par nous, ou nous périrons.
      La plupart d’entre nous croient qu’ils n’ont plus à chercher l’Utopie. C’est ce que nous avons, ici, main- tenant. Tous les jours, les propos que mon ami m’a tenus dans notre cuisine sont répétés et transmis pour former un cercle de plus en plus grand, porteur d’un message de paix et de bonne volonté.

    - IL Y A UNE SOLUTION
    - "Chez les AA, il y a des milliers d’hommes et de femmes qui ont connu un jour
      le même désespoir que Bill. Presque tous se sont rétablis. Ils ont trouvé une
      solution à leur problème d’alcool.\nNous sommes des Américains moyens. Toutes
      les régions de ce pays et plusieurs métiers et professions sont représentés,
      de même que plusieurs milieux, dont les milieux politiques, économiques, sociaux
      et reli- gieux. Nous sommes des gens qui normalement, ne nous fréquenterions
      pas. Cependant, il règne parmi nous un esprit d’appartenance, une amitié et
      une com- préhension merveilleuses difficiles à décrire. Nous sommes comme les
      passagers d’un paquebot immé- diatement après avoir été sauvés d’un naufrage,
      alors que de la troisième classe à la table du capitaine, il règne un esprit
      de camaraderie, de joie et de démo- cratie. Contrairement aux émotions des rescapés
      du navire, notre joie d’avoir évité la catastrophe ne s’éteint toutefois pas
      après que chacun a repris sa route. Le sentiment d’avoir traversé la même épreuve
      est un des éléments du lien puissant qui nous unit. Mais, à lui seul, ce sentiment
      ne nous aurait pas rapprochés les uns des autres comme nous le sommes maintenant.\nCe
      qu’il y a d’extraordinaire pour chacun de nous, c’est que nous avons découvert
      une solution commu- ne. Nous avons une façon de nous en sortir sur laquel- le
      nous sommes absolument d’accord et qui nous unit dans une action amicale et
      harmonieuse. C’est là la grande nouvelle que ce livre annonce à ceux qui souf-
      frent d’alcoolisme.\nUne maladie de ce genre – nous en sommes venus à tenir
      l’alcoolisme pour une maladie – affecte notre entourage comme aucune autre maladie
      ne peut le faire. Un malade atteint du cancer attire la sympathie de tous, mais
      personne d’autre n’en est irrité ou blessé. Il n’en est pas ainsi de l’alcoolisme,
      car cette maladie entraî- ne l’anéantissement de tout ce qui compte dans la
      vie. Elle affecte tous ceux qui entretiennent des relations avec la personne
      atteinte. Source de mésentente et de ressentiment féroce, l’alcoolisme est cause
      d’insécuri- té financière, dégoûte employeurs et amis, compromet le bonheur
      d’enfants innocents, de conjoints et de parents, sème la tristesse dans les
      familles. On pour- rait allonger la liste.\nNous espérons que notre livre renseignera
      et récon- fortera ceux qui sont ou qui pourraient être atteints par ce mal.
      Il y en a beaucoup.\nDes psychiatres très compétents qui ont été en contact
      avec nous n’ont pu réussir à convaincre un alcoolique de discuter de son cas
      sans réserve. Chose étrange, nos femmes, nos parents et nos amis intimes trouvent
      généralement encore plus difficile d’établir un contact avec nous.\nEn revanche,
      l’ex-buveur qui a trouvé notre solution et qui connaît bien les faits en ce
      qui le concerne peut généralement gagner l’entière confiance d’un autre alcoolique
      en quelques heures. Tant qu’il n’y a pas cette compréhension mutuelle, rien,
      ou presque rien, ne peut être accompli.\nLe fait d’être abordé par une personne
      qui a déjà ren- contré la même difficulté, d’entendre cette personne\nparler
      indéniablement de ce qu’elle connaît, de voir dans son comportement même qu’elle
      détient la vraie réponse, de constater qu’elle ne se pose pas en être moralement
      supérieur et qu’elle est mue par le désir sin- cère d’aider, le fait aussi qu’il
      n’y ait aucun frais à payer, personne à flatter, aucune remontrance à subir,
      voilà les conditions que nous avons trouvées les plus efficaces. Nombreux sont
      ceux qui ont pris leur grabat et se sont mis à marcher après avoir fait une
      telle démarche.\nAucun d’entre nous ne consacre tout son temps à ce travail
      et nous ne croyons pas que nous serions plus efficaces si nous le faisions.
      Nous croyons que d’arrê- ter de boire n’est que le début. Il est encore plus
      impor- tant de mettre nos principes à l’œuvre dans nos propres foyers, dans
      nos activités et notre travail. Nous consa crons tous une grande partie de nos
      loisirs à fournir les efforts que nous décrivons plus loin dans ce livre. Certains
      ont la chance de pouvoir y consacrer presque tout leur temps.\nÀ agir comme
      nous le faisons, il est certain qu’un grand bien résultera de nos efforts, mais
      le problème aura été à peine effleuré. Ceux d’entre nous qui vivent dans une
      grande ville sont ébranlés à l’idée que, tout près, des centaines tombent dans
      l’oubli chaque jour. Plusieurs d’entre eux pourraient se rétablir s’ils avaient
      la chance que nous avons eue. Alors comment leur offrir ce qui nous a été donné
      si gratuitement ?\nNous avons donc décidé de publier un livre anony- me qui
      expliquerait le problème tel que nous le per- cevons et dans lequel toute notre
      expérience et toutes nos connaissances seraient mises à contribution. Toute
      personne aux prises avec un problème d’alcool devrait y trouver un programme
      d’action efficace.\nIl était nécessaire d’inclure dans notre livre des questions
      d’ordre médical, psychiatrique, social et religieux. Nous sommes conscients
      que ces sujets peuvent sou- lever des controverses. Rien ne nous plairait autant
      que d’écrire un ouvrage qui ne contienne ni matière à débat ou à dispute. Nous
      ferons tout ce que nous pourrons pour atteindre cet objectif. Nous croyons,
      pour la plu- part, que la tolérance des travers et des points de vue d’autrui,
      et le respect des opinions de chacun sont des attitudes qui permettent d’être
      d’un plus grand secours aux autres. Notre vie même, parce que nous sommes des
      ex-buveurs, dépend de notre souci constant des autres et de la façon dont nous
      pouvons leur venir en aide.\nPeut-être vous demandez-vous déjà comment nous
      sommes arrivés à nous rendre malades à ce point en buvant. Sans doute aimeriez-vous
      savoir pourquoi et comment, en dépit de l’avis contraire d’experts en la matière,
      nous nous sommes tirés d’une condition phy- sique et mentale désespérée. Si
      vous êtes alcoolique et que vous voulez vos en sortir, il se peut que, déjà,
      vous soyez en train de vous demander : « Que dois- je faire ? »\nL’objectif
      de ce livre est d’apporter des réponses pré- cises à ce genre de questions.
      Toutefois, avant de vous dire ce que nous avons fait et d’entrer dans des expli-
      cations détaillées, il nous semble indiqué de vous faire connaître succinctement
      notre point de vue sur cer- taines choses.\nCombien de fois ne nous a-t-on pas
      dit : « Moi, je peux cesser de boire quand je veux. Pourquoi pas lui ? » ; «
      Si tu ne peux pas boire raisonnablement, tu ferais mieux d’arrêter. » ; « Celui-là
      est incapable de se maîtriser quand il s’agit d’alcool. » ; « Pour- quoi n’essaies-tu
      pas la bière ou le vin ? » ; « Laisse les boissons alcoolisées. » ; « Il manque
      sûrement de volonté. » ; « Il pourrait cesser s’il le voulait. » ; « Elle est
      tellement gentille que par égard pour elle il devrait cesser de boire. » ; «
      Le médecin lui a dit qu’il mourrait s’il continuait de boire, mais il est toujours
      rond comme un œuf. »\nCe sont là des lieux communs que nous entendons souvent.
      Ils dénotent un monde d’ignorance et de mal- entendus, et sont le fait de personnes
      qui réagissent fort différemment de nous face à l’alcool.\nLe buveur modéré
      abandonne facilement l’alcool s’il a une bonne raison pour le faire. Dans son
      cas, cesser de boire ne pose aucun problème.\nIl y a également le cas du gros
      buveur. Il peut avoir développé cette habitude au point d’en avoir affecté progressivement
      sa santé physique et mentale. Sa vie peut même en être écourtée. Cependant,
      s’il est moti- vé par une raison suffisamment sérieuse comme une santé défaillante,
      une nouvelle relation amoureuse, un changement d’environnement ou encore une
      sévère mise en garde de son médecin, ce buveur parviendra, sinon à couper l’alcool
      complètement, du moins à modérer sa consommation, même s’il trouve cela dif-
      ficile ou contrariant. Il pourrait même avoir besoin d’une assistance médicale.\nMais
      que dire du véritable alcoolique ? Il a d’abord pu être un buveur modéré ; il
      peut par la suite devenir ou non un gros buveur, mais il vient un temps où dès
      qu’il commence à boire, il ne peut plus s’arrêter.\nSon comportement vous rend
      perplexe, en particu- lier par son manque de contrôle. Il a des gestes absurdes,
      inexplicables et tragiques lorsqu’il boit. Il fait alors penser au Dr Jekyll
      et M. Hyde. Il est rarement à moitié ivre. Il est plutôt, en tout temps, plus
      ou moins ivre à en perdre la raison. Quand il boit, son comportement n’est pas
      normal. C’est peut-être la personne la plus agréable au monde mais une jour-
      née à boire le rendra souvent exécrable et même dan- gereusement antisocial.
      Il a le don de s’enivrer quand précisément il ne le faudrait pas, particulièrement
      lors- qu’il doit prendre une décision importante ou tenir un engagement. Souvent,
      c’est un être parfaitement sensé et bien équilibré en tout, sauf en ce qui concerne
      l’alcol ; sur ce point, il est incroyablement égoïste et malhonnête. Souvent
      aussi, c’est un sujet talen- tueux et doué, qui possède des aptitudes particulières
      et qui a devant lui une carrière prometteuse. Il utilise ses talents pour assurer
      à lui-même et aux siens un avenir brillant. Puis, par une série de cuites insen-
      sées, il détruit ce qu’il a édifié. On croirait que dans l’état d’ivresse où
      il se trouve lorsqu’il se couche, il devrait dormir au moins douze heures d’affilée.
      Pour- tant, dès son réveil le lendemain matin, il cherche avidement la bouteille
      qu’il a égarée la veille. Lors- qu’il en a les moyens, il dissimule des bouteilles
      dans toute la maison, de crainte qu’on ne lui prenne ses provisions pour les
      jeter à l’évier. À mesure que les choses s’aggravent, il se tourne progressivement
      vers des sédatifs puissants qu’il mêle à l’alcool pour se calmer et être en
      état de se rendre à son travail. Vient un jour où il est incapable de continuer
      et il rre plausibles, aucun ne fait le poids devant les ravages d’une cuite.
      Les raisons invoquées par l’alcoolique s’apparentent à celles de l’homme qui
      se frapperait le crâne à coups de marteau pour ne pas sentir son mal de tête.
      Si vous faites observer à un alcoolique l’ab- surdité de son raisonnement, ou
      il s’en moquera, ou il s’en irritera et refusera de parler.\nParfois, l’alcoolique
      répondra franchement ; cepen- dant, si étrange que cela puisse sembler, il ne
      sait pas plus que vous ce qui l’a poussé à prendre ce premier verre. Certains
      buveurs ont des excuses dont ils sont assez contents, mais au fond d’eux-mêmes,
      ils ne savent pas pourquoi ils agissent de la sorte. Une fois qu’ils sont dominés
      par ce mal, ils deviennent confus. D’une part, ils sont obsédés par l’idée qu’un
      jour ils réussi- ront à s’en sortir et d’autre part, ils se doutent bien que
      la partie est perdue.\nPeu de gens sont capables de mesurer à quel point cela
      est vrai. La famille et les amis de l’alcoolique sen- tent vaguement que celui-ci
      est anormal, mais chacun attend le jour où il sortira de sa léthargie et retrouve-
      ra sa force de volonté.\nLa vérité tragique est que s’il s’agit d’un véritable
      alcoolique, ce jour peut ne jamais arriver. Il a perdu tout contrôle. Tout alcoolique
      atteint le stade où même la plus grande volonté de cesser de boire n’est plus
      d’aucun secours. Dans presque tous les cas, ce moment tragique survient bien
      avant qu’on ne l’ait soupçonné.\nNous sommes forcés de reconnaître que la plupart
      d’entre nous, alcooliques, pour une raison inconnue, avons perdu notre liberté
      de choix devant l’alcool ; notre prétendue volonté n’existe à peu près plus.
      Par- fois, nous sommes incapables de nous rappeler suffi- samment les souffrances
      et l’humilité subies un mois ou même une semaine plus tôt. Nous sommes sans
      défense devant le premier verre.\nLes conséquences presque certaines qu’un seul
      verre de bière va entraîner ne nous viennent pas à l’idée afin de nous en dissuader.
      Si ces pensées nous arrivent, elles sont floues et vite chassées par cette idée
      tenace que cette fois, nous allons nous comporter comme les autres. Nos mécanismes
      de défense sont totalement mis en échec, comme celui qui nous retient de mettre
      la main sur un poêle brûlant.\n« Cette fois, je ne me brûlerai pas, et voici
      com- ment je vais m’y prendre ! » se convainc l’alcoolique, le plus naturellement
      du monde. Parfois, aussi, il ne réfléchit pas du tout. Combien de fois, après
      un pre- mier verre pris distraitement, ne nous sommes-nous pas demandé, au troisième
      ou au quatrième : « Pour l’amour de Dieu, comment ai-je bien pu recommencer
      ? » Puis, nous nous sommes tout de suite dit : « J’arrêterai après le sixième
      » ou encore, « De toute façon, à quoi bon essayer ? »\nLorsque cette manière
      de penser s’est bien installée dans l’esprit du buveur alcoolique, tout secours
      humain est déjà probablement devenu inutile et le malade en moura ou perdra
      totalement la raison, à moins qu’il ne soit enfermé avant. Ces faits choquants
      et brutaux ont été confirmés par une foule d’alcooliques au cours de l’histoire.
      Cependant, n’eût été la grâce de Dieu, nous compterions des milliers d’autres
      exemples de ce genre. Il y a tant de buveurs qui veulent arrêter de boire, mais
      qui ne le peuvent pas.\nIl y a une solution. La plupart d’entre nous n’ai- mions
      pas l’idée de faire notre inventaire, de marcher sur notre amour-propre, d’admettre
      nos défauts, toutes choses nécessaires pour que le processus de rétablis- sement
      réussisse pleinement. Cependant, nous avons vu que cela avait réellement marché
      pour d’autres et nous en étions venus à croire que la vie, telle que nous la
      vivions, était futile et sans espoir. C’est pourquoi, lorsque nous avons été
      abordés par ceux qui avaient réglé leur problème d’alcool, il ne nous restait
      rien d’autre à faire que de prendre le simple coffre d’outils spirituel qui
      nous était offert. Nous avons découvert un coin du paradis et nous avons été
      propulsés dans une quatrième dimension de l’existence que jamais nous n’aurions
      pu imaginer.\nC’est un fait évident, et rien de moins : nous avons fait une
      expérience spirituelle* profonde et réelle, qui a complètement transformé notre
      attitude devant la vie, envers les autres ainsi qu’envers Dieu et son univers.
      Notre vie est maintenant centrée sur la certitude abso- lue que le Créateur
      est entré dans nos cœurs et dans nos vies par miracle. Il a commencé à faire
      pour nous des choses que nous n’aurions jamais pu réussir par nous-mêmes.\nSi
      vous êtes un alcoolique aussi gravement atteint que nous l’étions, nous croyons
      qu’il n’y a pas de demi- mesure si vous voulez régler votre problème. Nous en
      étions au point où la vie devenait impossible à vivre et si nous étions parvenus
      au stade où toute aide humai- ne est inutile, il ne nous restait que deux solutions
      : continuer jusqu’au bout en faisant taire, du mieux que nous aurions pu, la
      conscience que nous avions de notre intolérable situation ou accepter une aide
      spirituelle. Nous avons choisi la deuxième solution parce que nous désirions
      sincèrement nous rétablir et que nous étions prêts à fournir les efforts nécessaires.\nVoici
      l’histoire d’un homme d’affaires américain qui, bien que connu pour son talent,
      son jugement et saforte personnalité, errait d’une clinique à l’autre. Après
      avoir consulté les plus grands psychiatres des États- Unis, il était allé en
      Europe pour rencontrer un méde- cin réputé, (le Dr Jung, psychiatre) qui l’a
      traité. Bien que les expériences passées de cet homme d’affaires l’ait rendu
      sceptique, il montrait une confiance peu commune à la fin du traitement. Sa
      forme physique et mentale était exceptionnellement bonne. Surtout, croyait-il,
      il avait acquis une telle connaissance des mécanismes de son esprit et de ses
      moindres ressorts qu’il était impensable qu’il puisse rechuter. Néanmoins, peu
      de temps après, il était de nouveau ivre. Le plus déconcertant était qu’il ne
      trouvait aucune explication satisfaisante à sa rechute.\nIl est retourné voir
      le célèbre médecin qu’il admi- rait grandement, et il lui a demandé de but en
      blanc de lui dire clairement pourquoi il ne pouvait pas se rétablir. Il désirait
      par-dessus tout redevenir maître de lui-même. Il semblait plutôt rationnel et
      bien équilibré face à d’autres problèmes. Pourtant, il ne parvenait pas à se
      maîtriser devant l’alcool. Comment expliquer cela ?\nIl a supplié le médecin
      de lui dire toute la vérité, et il l’a entendue. Selon le médecin, son cas était
      abso- lument désespéré ; jamais il ne retrouverait sa place dans la société
      et, s’il tenait à vivre longtemps, il allait devoir s’enfermer ou avoir recours
      aux services d’un garde du corps. Ainsi parlait un médecin renommé.\nMais cet
      homme vit encore et de plus, il est libre ; il n’est pas enfermé et n’a pas
      besoin d’un garde du corps. Sur la planète, il peut aller sans danger partout
      où vont les hommes libres, à la condition qu’il accep- te d’adopter une certaine
      conduite toute simple.\nCertains parmi les alcooliques qui lisent ce livre peuvent
      croire qu’ils sont capables de s’en sortir sans une aide spirituelle. Voici,
      pour vous, la suite de la conversation entre notre ami et son médecin.\n« Vous
      avez l’état d’esprit d’un alcoolique chro- nique, lui a déclaré le médecin.
      À ma connaissance, aucune personne atteinte comme vous l’êtes ne s’est jamais
      rétablie. » Notre ami a eu l’impression que les portes de l’enfer se refermaient
      brusquement sur lui.\n« N’y a-t-il pas d’exception ? » demanda-t-il au médecin.\n«
      Oui, répliqua celui-ci, il y en a. Des exceptions à des cas comme le vôtre existent
      depuis les temps anciens. De temps à autre, des alcooliques ont parfois vécu
      ce qu’on appelle une expérience spirituelle vita- le. Je considère ces événements
      comme des phéno- mènes. On pourrait les assimiler à de grands transferts et
      réaménagements d’ordre émotionnel. Les idées, les émotions et les attitudes
      qui dictaient jadis à ces hommes leur conduite sont soudainement mises de côté
      et ils deviennent dominés par un ensemble de concep- tions et de principes entièrement
      nouveaux. J’ai tenté de provoquer ce genre de réaménagement émotionnel en vous.
      Mes méthodes ont réussi avec beaucoup de personnes mais n’ont jamais donné de
      résultats dans un cas comme le vôtre. »*\nCes paroles ont eu pour effet de rassurer
      un peu notre ami, qui était tout de même, se disait-il, un membre fidèle de
      l’Église. Cependant, son espoir s’est évanoui lorsque le médecin lui a affirmé
      qu’en dépit de la qualité de ses convictions religieuses, celles-ci ne pouvaient
      dans son cas donner lieu à l’expérience spi- rituelle vitale nécessaire. \nVoilà
      dans quelle terrible situation se trouvait notre ami lorsqu’il a vécu l’expérience
      extraordinaire qui, comme nous l’avons dit,a fait de lui un homme libre.\nNous
      avons, à notre tour, cherché la même issue, avec l’énergie désespérée de celui
      qui se noie. Ce qui semblait d’abord être un mince roseau s’est révélé être
      la main forte et secourable de Dieu. Une nouvelle vie ou plutôt un « mode de
      vie » vraiment efficace nous a été offert.\nDans son livre Varieties of Religious
      Experience, l’éminent psychologue américain William James expo- se une multitude
      de démarches qui ont mené les hommes à Dieu. Notre intention n’est pas de convaincre
      qui que ce soit qu’il n’y a qu’une façon d’acquérir la foi. Si ce que nous avons
      vu, appris et senti a un sens, nous tous, de quelque race, croyance ou couleur
      que nous soyons, sommes les enfants d’un Créateur vivant avec qui nous pouvons
      établir une relation faite de sim- plicité et de compréhension dès que nous
      sommes prêts et assez honnête pour essayer. Ceux qui appartiennent à une religion
      n’y trouveront rien de contraire à leurs convictions ou à leur culte. Aucune
      friction n’existe entre nous sur ces questions.\nNous croyons que l’appartenance
      de nos membres à quelque groupe religieux que ce soit ne nous concer- ne pas.
      Pour nous, la pratique religieuse est une affai- re entièrement personnelle
      que chacun doit régler à la lumière de ses affiliations passées ou de son choix
      pré- sent. D’ailleurs, nos membres ne font pas tous partie de groupes religieux
      mais la plupart d’entre nous sommes en faveur d’une telle appartenance.\nDans
      le chapitre suivant, nous décrivons l’alcoolis- me tel que nous le comprenons.
      Suit un chapitre des- tiné aux agnostiques. Nous comptons parmi nos membres
      plusieurs personnes qui jadis étaient de ceux- là. Il est pour le moins étonnant
      de constater que ce n’est pas là un obstacle sérieux à une expérience spi- rituelle.\nPlus
      loin dans le livre, nous expliquons très claire- ment comment nous nous sommes
      rétablis. Viennent ensuite quarante-deux témoignages.\nChaque alcoolique y relate,
      dans ses propres mots et selon son propre point de vue, la façon dont il s’est
      mis en contact avec Dieu. Les auteurs de ces récits sont représentatifs de nos
      membres et donnent une des- cription fidèle de ce qui s’est produit dans leur
      vie.\nNous espérons que ces révélations intimes ne seront pas jugées de mauvais
      goût. Nous voudrions que nombre d’alcooliques, hommes et femmes, qui ont désespérément
      besoin d’aide, lisent ces pages, et nous croyons que c’est seulement en nous
      ouvrant complè- tement et en dévoilant nos problèmes que nous les amè- nerons
      à dire : « Oui, je suis comme eux, moi aussi ; il faut que j’aie ce qu’ils ont.
      »\n"

    - AUTRES DONNÉES SUR L ’ ALCOOLISME
    - "La plupart d’entre nous avons été réticents à admettre que nous étions de véritables
      alcoo- liques. Personne ne trouve agréable de penser que men- talement et physiquement
      on est différent des autres. Il n’est donc pas étonnant que nos vies de buveurs
      aient été marquées par d’innombrables et inutiles tentatives pour prouver que
      nous pouvions boire comme tout le monde. La grande obsession de tout buveur
      anormal est qu’un jour, il ne sait trop comment, il parviendra à se contrôler
      et à prendre plaisir à boire. Il est ren- versant de constater à quel point
      cette illusion peut per- sister. Nombreux sont ceux qui s’y accrochent jusqu’aux
      portes de la folie ou de la mort.\nNous avons appris à accepter, jusqu’au plus
      profond de notre être, que nous étions alcooliques. C’est la pre- mière étape
      vers le rétablissement. Toute illusion que nous sommes comme les autres ou qu’un
      jour nous le deviendrons doit être dissipée.\nNous, les alcooliques, sommes
      des hommes et des femmes qui avons perdu la faculté de maîtriser notre consommation
      d’alcool. Nous savons que jamais un alcoolique véritable ne retrouve cette maîtrise.
      Nous avons tous eu, à un moment donné, l’impression de nous ressaisir ; mais
      ces sursis, généralement courts, étaient suivis d’un manque de contrôle encore
      plus grand qui menait, éventuellement, à un découragement pitoyable et incompréhensible.
      Nous sommes tous convaincus que les alcooliques de notre catégorie sont aux
      prises avec une maladie progressive. À la longue, notre condition va sans cesse
      en s’aggravant, elle ne s’améliore jamais.\nNous ressemblons à des personnes
      qui n’ont plus de jambes : elles ne repousseront jamais. Il ne semble exister
      aucun traitement qui permette à des alcooliques comme nous de ressembler aux
      autres. Nous avons essayé tous les remèdes possibles. Parfois certains nous
      ont apporté un bref moment de répit, qui était toujours suivi par une récidive
      encore plus grave. Les médecins qui connaissent l’alcoolisme s’accordent à dire
      qu’il est impossible pour un alcoolique de redevenir un buveur normal. Peut-être
      un jour la science apportera-t-elle la solution, mais ce n’est pas encore fait.\nMalgré
      ce que nous pouvons dire, nombreux sont les vrais alcooliques qui ne croiront
      pas appartenir à cette catégorie. En se leurrant eux-mêmes et par toutes sortes
      de moyens, ils tenteront de se prouver qu’ils sont des exceptions à la règle
      et que par conséquent, ils ne sont pas alcooliques. Nous sommes prêts à lever
      notre chapeau à la personne qui, s’étant révélée un jour inca- pable de se maîtriser
      devant l’alcool, réussit ensuite à consommer normalement. Dieu sait les nombreux
      et pénibles efforts que nous avons faits pour tenter de boire comme tout le
      monde !\nVoici quelques-unes des méthodes que nous avons essayées : boire seulement
      de la bière ; limiter le nombre de consommations ; ne jamais boire seul ; ne
      jamais boire le matin ; boire seulement à la maison ; ne pas garder d’alcool
      chez soi ; ne pas boire durant les heures de travail ; boire seulement en société
      ; lais- ser le scotch pour le cognac ; ne boire que du vin ; accepter de donner
      notre démission s’il nous arrivait de nous enivrer au travail ; partir en voyage
      ; ne pas partir en voyage ; jurer, ou simplement promettre, de ne plus jamais
      boire ; faire plus d’exercice physique ; lire des ouvrages pour se motiver ;
      séjourner quelque temps dans une maison de repos à la campagne ou dans une clinique
      ; accepter de recevoir des soins psychia- triques. La liste pourrait s’allonger
      à l’infini.\nIl est toujours délicat d’affirmer de quelqu’un qu’il est alcoolique
      mais chacun peut facilement établir son propre diagnostic. Rendez-vous au bar
      le plus près et voyez si vous pouvez boire raisonnablement. Essayez de boire
      et de vous arrêter tout d’un coup. Répétez l’expérience plusieurs fois. Vous
      saurez vite à quoi vous en tenir si vous êtes honnête avec vous-même. Cela vaut
      peut-être la peine de risquer une bonne crise de tremblements pour être tout
      à fait fixé sur sa condi- tion.\nBien que nous ne soyons pas en mesure de le
      prou- ver, nous croyons que la plupart d’entre nous aurions pu mettre un terme
      à notre mauvaise habitude dès le début. Mais peu d’alcooliques désirent vraiment
      arrê- ter de boire quand il en est encore temps. On a rele- vé quelques cas
      d’individus qui, malgré la manifestation certaine de tous les signes de l’alcoolis-
      me, ont réussi pendant longtemps à ne pas boire grâce à un puissant désir de
      s’en sortir. En voici un exemple.\nUn homme de trente ans faisait souvent la
      fête. Très nerveux le lendemain de ses beuveries, il se calmait avec encore
      un peu plus d’alcool. Il désirait ardem- ment réussir en affaires mais il se
      rendait compte qu’il n’accomplirait rien de bon tant qu’il toucherait à l’al-
      cool. Une fois qu’il avait commencé à boire, il ne pou- vait plus s’arrêter.
      Il a donc pris la décision de ne plus avaler une seule goutte d’alcool tant
      qu’il n’aurait pas réussi dans la vie et qu’il ne serait pas à la retraite.
      Homme exceptionnel, il est demeuré totalement absti- nent pendant vingt-cinq
      ans et il a pris sa retraite à cin- quante-cinq ans après une carrière fructueuse
      et heureuse dans le monde des affaires. Il a alors com- mis l’erreur de croire,
      comme presque tous les alcoo- liques, qu’en raison de sa longue abstinence et
      compte tenu de sa discipline personnelle, il pouvait boire comme les autres.
      Il a donc mis ses pantoufles et ouvert une bouteille. Deux mois plus tard, il
      se présentait à l’hôpital, confus et humilié. Pendant quelque temps, il a fait
      des efforts pour contrôler sa consommation mais au cours de cette période, il
      est retourné plusieurs fois à l’hôpital. Puis, prenant son courage à deux mains,
      il a tenté de cesser de boire complètement pour décou- vrir qu’il en était incapable.
      Ne regardant pas à la dépense, il a pris tous les moyens possibles pour régler
      son problème mais toutes ses- lèlement à notre raisonnement sensé : inévitablement,
      il nous donnait des excuses insensées et injustifiées pour prendre notre premier
      verre. Notre bon sens ne parvenait pas à nous retenir et la déraison prenait
      le dessus. Le lendemain, en toute sincérité et le plus sérieusement du monde,
      nous nous demandions com- ment cela avait bien pu arriver.\nEn certaines circonstances,
      nous nous sommes déli- bérément enivrés, nous croyant justifiés par la nervo-
      sité, la colère, l’inquiétude, la dépression, la jalousie ou un sentiment du
      même genre. Cependant, même dans ces cas-là, nous sommes forcés d’admettre notre
      démesure et la légèreté de l’excuse – qui selon nous justifiait notre rechute
      – compte tenu de ce qui s’en- suivrait. Aujourd’hui nous voyons bien que lorsque
      nous recommencions à boire, volontairement et non fortuitement, nous n’avions
      pas réfléchi sérieusement aux conséquences énormes qui en résulteraient.\nNotre
      réaction devant le premier verre est aussi absurde et aussi incompréhensible
      que celle d’un indi- vidu qui, par exemple, aurait la manie de se faufiler entre
      les voitures pour traverser la rue. Cherchant les sensations fortes, il prend
      plaisir à éviter les automobiles. Malgré les mises en garde d’amis bienveillants,
      il s’amuse à ce jeu pendant quelques années. Jusque- là, il passe pour un drôle
      d’individu ayant des idées bien étranges sur la façon de s’amuser. Un jour,
      la chance l’abandonne et il se fait blesser légèrement plusieurs fois de suite.
      Tout individu normal devrait, dès ce moment-là, renoncer à sa dangereuse manie.
      Mais le voilà de nouveau renversé par un véhicule et cette fois, il a le crâne
      fracturé. Dans le courant de la semaine suivant sa sortie de l’hôpital, un tramway
      lui casse un bras. Il vous dit qu’il a résolu de ne plus jamais se lancer au
      milieu de la rue mais au bout de quelques semaines, le voilà avec les deux jambes
      fracturées.\nPendant des années, il persiste dans sa manie mais toujours en
      promettant d’être plus prudent ou de s’abs- tenir d’aller dans la rue. Finalement,
      il ne peut plus travailler, sa femme obtient le divorce et il devient la risée
      de tous. Il tente par tous les moyens de se débar- rasser de sa fâcheuse habitude.
      À sa demande, il est enfermé dans un institut psychiatrique avec l’espoir de
      se corriger. Mais le jour où il met fin à sa retraite, il se jette devant un
      camion d’incendie qui lui fracture le dos. Il faut être fou pour agir comme
      ça, non ?\nPeut-être trouverez-vous notre comparaison carica- turale. L’est-elle
      vraiment ? Parce que nous sommes passés par de dures épreuves, nous sommes forcés
      d’ad- mettre qu’on pourrait raconter exactement la même his- toire à notre sujet,
      en substituant l’habitude de boire à celle de se lancer dans la circulation.
      Ce serait tout à fait nous. Si intelligents que nous ayons pu nous mon- trer
      en d’autres circonstances, nous étions frappés d’in- sanité dès qu’il s’agissait
      d’alcool. C’est dur à entendre, mais c’est la vérité. N’est-ce pas ? \nCertains
      d’entre vous doivent penser : « Oui, ce que vous nous dites est vrai, mais ça
      ne s’applique pas entièrement à notre cas. Nous admettons présenter quelques-uns
      de ces symptômes, mais nous n’avons pas atteint les mêmes extrêmes que vous
      et il y a peu de chance que cela nous arrive car après ce que vous nous avez
      dit, de telles choses ne peuvent pas se reprodui- re. L’alcool ne nous a pas
      tout fait perdre dans la vie, et nous n’avons certainement pas l’intention d’en
      arri- ver là. Merci pour l’information. »\nC’est peut être vrai en ce qui concerne
      certains non- alcooliques qui, bien que buvant beaucoup et de façon déraisonnable
      aujourd’hui, sont capables de cesser de boire ou de se modérer parce que leur
      cerveau et leur corps n’ont pas été endommagés comme les nôtres. Mais pour ainsi
      dire, tous les alcooliques actifs ou en puissance sont absolument incapables
      de cesser de boire du simple fait qu’ils ont une certaine connais- sance d’eux-mêmes.
      Nous voulons insister sur ce point encore et encore pour que nos lecteurs alcooliques
      se le mettent bien dans la tête, car nous avons découvert cette vérité au prix
      de cruelles expériences. Passons à un autre cas.\nFred est membre associé d’un
      bureau de comptables bien connu. Il gagne un bon revenu, possède une belle maison.
      Il est heureux en ménage, et ses enfants font des études prometteuses au collège.
      Sa personnalité agréable le fait se lier d’amitié avec tout le monde. Fred est
      l’exemple parfait de l’homme d’affaires qui a réussi. Il donne l’impression
      d’un être stable, bien équi- libré. Pourtant, il est alcoolique. Nous avons
      rencontré Fred pour la première fois il y a un an à l’hôpital où il se remettait
      d’une crise de convulsions alcooliques. C’était la première fois que cela lui
      arrivait et il en avait terriblement honte. Loin d’admettre qu’il était alcoolique,
      il se disait qu’il était venu à l’hôpital pour se calmer les nerfs. Le médecin
      lui a bien fait com- prendre qu’il allait plus mal qu’il le croyait. Pendant
      quelques jours, cette nouvelle l’a déprimé. Il a décidé de renoncer complètement
      à l’alcool. Jamais il ne lui est venu à l’esprit qu’il ne pourrait pas y arriver
      mal- gré sa force de caractère et son rang social. Fred refu- sait de reconnaître
      qu’il était alcoolique et il était encore moins disposé à accepter une solution
      spirituelle à son problème. Nous lui avons dit ce que nous savions de l’alcoolisme.
      Intéressé, il a reconnu qu’il présentait quelques-uns des symptômes mais il
      était loin d’ad- mettre qu’il ne pouvait pas s’en sortir tout seul. Il croyait
      ferme que son expérience humiliante jointe aux connaissances qu’il avait acquises
      suffiraient à l’em- pêcher de boire pour le reste de ses jours. La connais-
      sance de soi réglerait son problème.\nNous sommes restés sans nouvelles de Fred
      pendant quelque temps. Un jour, on nous a appris qu’il avait été de nouveau
      hospitalisé. Cette fois, il était fortement ébranlé. Il n’a pas tardé à demander
      à nous voir. Ce qu’il nous a dit alors est des plus instructif, car nous sommes
      ici en présence d’un homme convaincu qu’il doit cesser de boire, qui n’a aucune
      excuse de s’adon- ner à l’alcool, qui démontre un jugement et une déter- mination
      remarquables en tout ce qui a trait au reste, et qui s’était pourtant cassé
      la figure.\nÉcoutons-le raconter son histoire : « J’avais été bien impressionné
      par ce que vous m’aviez dit de l’alcoo- lisme et je croyais sincèrement qu’il
      était impossible que je recommence à boire. J’avais pris note de vos opinions
      quant à la folie subite qui s’empare de l’es- prit avant le premier verre, mais
      j’étais certain que cela ne m’arriverait pas après ce que j’avais appris. Je
      me disais que mon cas était moins grave que le vôtre, que j’avais généralement
      réussi à régler mes autres pro- blèmes personnels et que je réussirais là où
      vous aviez échoué. Il me semblait que j’avais toutes les raisons d’avoir confiance
      et qu’il suffisait d’avoir de la volon- té et de me tenir sur mes gardes.\n«
      J’ai repris le travail avec ces convictions et tout s’est bien passé pendant
      un certain temps. Je n’avais aucune difficulté à refuser les consommations,
      si bien que je commençais à me demander si je n’avais pas exagéré la gravité
      de mon cas. Un jour, je suis allé à Washington pour soumettre un dossier comptable
      à un bureau du gouvernement. J’avais déjà eu l’occasion de voyager du temps
      où j’avais cessé de boire. Il n’y avait donc là rien de nouveau pour moi. Je
      me sentais bien physiquement et j’avais l’esprit libre de tout tracas. Mon rendez-vous
      avait été un succès. J’étais content et je savais que mes partenaires le seraient
      aussi. Une journée parfaite prenait fin, sans un nuage à l’horizon.\n« Je me
      suis rendu à l’hôtel et me suis préparé tran- quillement pour le dîner. Lorsque
      j’ai passé le seuil de la salle à manger, l’idée m’est venue que je pourrais
      bien agrémenter mon dîner de quelques cocktails. Voilà, rien de plus. J’ai commandé
      un cocktail et mon repas. Puis j’ai demandé un autre cocktail. Après le dîner,
      j’ai décidé d’aller me promener. À mon retour à l’hôtel, j’ai pensé qu’une consommation
      me ferait du bien avant d’aller me coucher et je me suis dirigé vers le bar
      et j’ai pris un verre. Je me souviens d’en avoir bu plusieurs autres ce soir-là,
      et encore le lendemain matin. J’ai un vague souvenir de m’être trouvé à bord
      d’un avion à destination de New York et d’avoir trou- vé, à l’aéroport, un chauffeur
      de taxi sympathique au lieu de ma femme. Le chauffeur m’a accompagné dans mes
      allées et venues pendant plusieurs jours. Je me souviens très peu de ce que
      j’ai dit ou fait, ou des endroits où je suis allé. Puis de nouveau, le séjour
      à l’hôpital et les terribles souffrancesr l’approche spirituelle dans des cas
      comme les vôtres. La plupart du temps, il n’y a, à vrai dire, aucune autre solution.
      »\nNous le rappelons encore une fois : il y a des moments où l’alcoolique se
      trouve mentalement dému- ni devant le premier verre. Sauf de rares exceptions,
      lui, ni aucun autre être humain, ne peut lui fournir les moyens de se défendre.
      Le secours doit lui venir d’une Puissance supérieure.\n"

    - NOUS, LES AGNOSTIQUES
    - |
      Dans les chapitres précédents, vous avez eu des notions sur l’alcoolisme. Nous espérons que vous pourrez établir une distinction nette entre l’alcoolique et le non-alcoolique. Si vous ne parvenez pas à renoncer à l’alcool alors que vous le désirez sincèrement, et si, lorsque vous buvez, vous avez peu de contrôle sur la quantité que vous prenez, il est probable que vous êtes alcoolique. Si c’est le cas, votre maladie pourrait être de celles que seule une expérience spirituelle peut vaincre.
      Une démarche de ce genre peut sembler impossible à celui qui croit être athée ou agnostique, mais ne rien entreprendre signifie courir à la catastrophe, surtout si l’on est un alcoolique du type irrécupérable. Faire face à l’alternative de boire et de mourir d’alcoolisme ou de vivre en optant pour un mode de vie spirituel n’est pas toujours facile.
      Ce n’est pas si difficile non plus. Environ la moitié de nos premiers membres se trouvaient exactement dans ce cas. Au début, certains d’entre nous cherchaient à éviter la question, espérant contre toute espérance qu’ils n’étaient pas de véritables alcooliques. Après quelque temps, nous avons dû accepter le fait qu’il fal- lait donner un fondement spirituel à notre vie, sinon... Peut-être est-ce votre cas. Mais, gardez courage, nous n’étions pas loin de la moitié à nous croire athées ou agnostiques. Notre expérience prouve que vous ne devez pas être déconcertés.
      Si un simple code moral ou une meilleure philoso- phie de vie suffisaient à surmonter l’alcoolisme, nous serions nombreux à nous en être sortis depuis long- temps. Cependant, de tels principes et modes de pen- sée ne nous ont pas sauvés malgré tout ce que nous avons tenté. En fait, nous avons souhaité être d’une moralité parfaite, nous avons voulu de tout notre cœur nous accrocher à une certaine philosophie, mais nous n’avions pas la force nécessaire. Nos possibilités humaines, dirigées par notre volonté, n’étaient pas suf- fisantes ; nous avons lamentablement échoué.
      Notre impuissance nous posait un véritable dilemme : il fallait trouver une force grâce à laquelle nous pouvions vivre, et ce devait être une Puissance supérieure à nous-mêmes. Évidemment. Mais où et comment trouver cette Puissance ?
      C’est justement le sujet de ce livre. Le but princi- pal est de vous permettre de découvrir une Puissance supérieure à vous-même qui résoudra votre problème. Nous avons donc écrit un livre et nous croyons qu’il est autant spirituel que moral. Cela signifie, bien sûr, que nous allons parler de Dieu. Voilà une difficulté pour les agnostiques ! Lorsque nous parlons avec un nouveau, nous voyons souvent l’espoir se dessiner sur son visage pendant que nous discutons de son alcoo- lisme et que nous lui présentons notre Mouvement. Mais nous voyons sa figure se rembrunir lorsqu’il est question de spiritualité, surtout lorsque nous mention- nons le nom de Dieu, car nous venons de lui rappeler un sujet qu’il croyait avoir évité avec soin ou qu’il avait ignoré complètement.
      Nous savons ce qu’il ressent. Comme lui, nous avons eu des préjugés et avons douté sincèrement. Certains parmi nous se sont montrés violemment anti-religieux. Pour d’autres, le mot « Dieu » évoquait l’image de Celui qu’on leur avait imposé dans leur enfance comme un être impressionnant. Peut-être avons-nous rejeté cette conception particulière parce qu’elle nous semblait inadéquate. Nous avons cru alors avoir complètement abandonné l’idée de Dieu. Nous n’aimions pas l’idée de croire et de dépendre d’une Puissance supérieure à nous-mêmes, qui était pour nous signe de faiblesse et même de lâcheté. Nous regardions avec un profond scepticisme ce monde d’individus en guerre, de religions ennemies, de calamités inexplicables. Nous regardions avec mépris les nombreuses personnes qui se disaient pieuses. Comment un Être suprême pouvait-il être mêlé à tout cela ? Et de toute façon, qui pouvait savoir ce qu’était un Être suprême ? Pourtant, à d’autres moments, par une belle nuit étoilée, il nous arrivait de nous demander : « Mais alors, qui a créé tout cela ? » Nous étions alors remplis d’admiration et d’émerveillement, mais ce n’était qu’une impres- sion superficielle et vite envolée.
      Oui, nous les agnostiques, avons eu ces pensées et ces expériences. Cependant, nous tenons à vous rassu- rer tout de suite. Aussitôt que nous avons réussi à mettre de côté nos préjugés et que nous avons démontré le plus petit désir de croire en une Puissance supérieure, déjà les résultats ont commencé à se faire sentir, même si personne d’entre nous ne pouvait définir ni bien com- prendre cette Puissance, qui est Dieu.
      À notre grand soulagement, nous avons découvert qu’il n’était pas nécessaire de prendre la conception de Dieu de quelqu’un d’autre. Notre conception person- nelle, aussi inexacte fût-elle, nous permettait de nous rapprocher de Lui et d’établir un contact. Aussitôt admise l’existence possible d’une Intelligence créatri- ce, d’un Esprit de l’Univers sous-tendant la totalité des choses, nous avons senti que nous devenions plus forts et plus aptes à nous diriger, à condition toutefois de franchir d’autres étapes bien simples. Nous nous sommes rendu compte que Dieu ne se montre pas trop exigeant envers ceux qui Le cherchent. Pour nous, le Royaume de l’Esprit est large et vaste ; il englobe tout ; jamais il n’exclut, jamais il ne se ferme à ceux qui le cherchent avec ardeur. Il est ouvert, nous le croyons, à tous les hommes.
      Par conséquent, lorsque nous vous parlons de Dieu, nous parlons de votre propre conception de Dieu. Cela s’applique aussi à toutes les autres formes d’expres- sion spirituelle que vous trouverez dans ce livre. Ne laissez aucun de vos préjugés contre les termes de spi- ritualité vous empêcher de vous demander honnêtement ce qu’ils peuvent signifier pour vous. Au début, cette attitude nous a suffi pour commencer à grandir spiri- tuellement et à établir nos premières relations conscientes avec Dieu tel que nous Le concevions. Ensuite, nous en sommes venus à accepter beaucoup de choses qui nous avaient semblé complètement impensables. Voilà ce que c’est que d’évoluer, mais pour progresser, nous devions commencer quelque part. Ainsi, nous avons commencé avec notre propre concep- tion, si imparfaite fut-elle.
      Nous n’avions qu’une petite question à nous poser : « Est-ce que je crois ou veux croire en l’existence d’une Puissance supérieure à moi-même ? » Aussitôt qu’un homme peut affirmer qu’il croit, ou qu’il veut bien essayer de croire, pour nous, il se trouve incon- testablement sur la bonne voie. La preuve a souvent été faite, parmi nous, que sur cette pierre angulaire bien simple, une structure spirituelle merveilleuse- ment solide peut être érigée.*
      Voilà qui était une bonne nouvelle pour nous, qui avions tenu pour acquis l’impossibilité d’appliquer des principes spirituels sans accepter bien des choses qui nous semblaient difficiles à croire. Lorsqu’on nous avait proposé des approches spirituelles, combien de fois n’avions-nous pas dit : « J’aimerais bien avoir la foi de cet homme. Je suis certain que je réussirais si seulement je pouvais croire comme lui. Mais je ne peux pas accepter comme vraies les nombreuses affirmations de foi qui, pour lui, sont si claires. » Il était donc récon- fortant d’apprendre que nous pouvions commencer à un niveau plus simple.
      En plus d’une incapacité apparente d’accepter plu- sieurs aspects de la foi, nous avons souvent été gênés par notre obstination, notre sensibilité et nos préjugés aveugles. Plusieurs d’entre nous se sont montrés si ombrageux qu’ils se cabraient devant toute allusion à la spiritualité. Il fallait abandonner cette façon de pen- ser. Bien que certains de nous aient résisté, nous n’avons pas eu trop de mal à faire taire ces sentiments. Face a la destruction alcoolique, nous nous sommes rapidement ouvert aux choses spirituelles, tout comme nous avions essayé de le faire sur d’autres sujets. En ce sens, l’alcool a eu sur nous un important effet de persuasion : il nous a finalement forcés à devenir rai- sonnables. Le processus a parfois été fastidieux ; c’est pourquoi nous espérons que personne ne gardera ses préjugés aussi longtemps que certains de nous l’ont fait.
      Le lecteur se demande peut-être toujours pourquoi il devrait croire en une Puissance supérieure à lui- même. Nous croyons qu’il y a de bonnes raisons. Exa- minons-en quelques-unes.
      L’homme pratique d’aujourd’hui exige des faits et des résultats. Le XXe siècle est largement ouvert à toutes sortes de théories, mais celles-ci doivent être fondées sur des faits concrets. Par exemple, nombreuses sont les théories sur l’électricité. Tout le monde les accepte sans le moindre doute, sans contester. Pour- quoi ? Simplement parce qu’il est impossible d’expli- quer ce que l’on voit, ressent, maîtrise ou utilise sans tenir au départ certains faits pour acquis.
      De nos jours, tout le monde croit en une foule de choses considérées comme évidentes, mais pour les- quelles il n’existe aucune preuve tangible irrévocable. La science ne nous montre-t-elle pas qu’il n’est pas de preuve moins solide que ce que nous appelons juste- ment une preuve tangible ? Dans l’étude que l’hom- me fait du monde matériel, il est sans cesse démontré que les apparences ne correspondent pas du tout à la réalité intrinsèque. En voici une illustration.
      Toute poutre d’acier consiste en une masse d’électrons gravitant autour d’un noyau à une vitesse inimaginable. Ces corpuscules sont régis par des lois précises, qui sont les mêmes pour tout l’univers de la matière. Voilà ce que la science nous enseigne. Nous n’avons aucune raison d’en douter. En revanche, lorsque l’on nous demande de présumer qu’à l’origine de ce monde matériel et de cette vie, tels que nous les voyons, il y a une intelligence créa- trice, directrice et toute-puissante, tout de suite nos ins- tincts pervers refont surface et nous nous ingénions à nous persuader que ce n’est pas ainsi. Nous lisons des livres savants et nous nous livrons à des discussions oiseuses pour nous convaincre que l’univers peut s’expliquer sans l’existence de Dieu. Si nos suppositions s’avé- raient fondées, la vie n’aurait donc pas d’origine, elle ne signifierait rien et ne mènerait nulle part.
      Au lieu de reconnaître que nous sommes seulement les agents intelligents et les fers de lance d’un univers toujours en évolution et créé par Dieu, nous, agnos- tiques et athées, avions choisi de croire que l’intelli- gence humaine était le premier et le dernier mot, l’alpha et l’oméga, le début et la fin de tout. C’était un peu prétentieux, n’est-ce-pas ?
      Nous, qui avons pris cette voie discutable, nous vous demandons de mettre de côté vos préjugés, même ceux contre les organisations religieuses. Nous avons appris que malgré leurs faiblesses, les diverses religions ont servi de guides et ont fixé un but à des millions de personnes. Les gens de foi trouvent une raison logique à l’existence. Quant à nous, nous n’avions absolument aucune conception raisonnable. Nous prenions plaisir à mettre en pièces les croyances et les pratiques spiri- tuelles alors que nous aurions pu voir que des per- sonnes spirituelles de toutes races, couleurs et confessions démontraient un degré de stabilité, de bon- heur et de dévouement que nous aurions pu chercher à imiter.
      Nous préférions nous intéresser aux faiblesses de ces personnes et parfois, nous nous appuyions sur leurs défauts pour les condamner en bloc. Nous dénoncions l’ intolérance tout en étant nous-mêmes intolérants. Nous laissions quelques arbres tordus nous masquer la forêt et sa beauté. Jamais nous n’avions regardé hon- nêtement l’aspect spirituel de la vie.
      Dans nos témoignages individuels, vous trouverez beaucoup de façons d’aborder et de concevoir une Puissance supérieure à soi-même. L’approche ou la conception à laquelle nous donnons notre adhésion importe peu. L’expérience nous a enseigné que ce sont des questions qui ne devraient pas nous inquiéter dans l’optique qui nous intéresse. Il revient à chacun de régler ces questions lui-même.
      Cependant, il est un point sur lequel ces hommes et ces femmes s’accordent de façon remarquable. Tous ont développé une foi en une Puissance supérieure à eux-mêmes et, depuis, croient en Elle. Dans tous les cas, cette Puissance a accompli le miracle, l’humaine- ment impossible. Comme le disait un célèbre homme d’État américain, « Regardons le dossier ».
      Des milliers d’hommes et de femmes, en chair et en os, affirment catégoriquement qu’après en être venus à croire en une Puissance supérieure à eux-mêmes, avoir adopté une certaine attitude envers cette Puis- sance et avoir accepté de se prêter à certaines choses simples, ils ont vu un changement spectaculaire s’opé- rer dans leur façon de vivre et de penser. Au bord du désespoir, de l’effondrement et de la faillite totale de leurs ressources humaines, ces gens se sont sentis enva- his par un nouveau sentiment de force, de paix, de bon- heur et de discernement. Ce changement s’est produit peu de temps après qu’ils ont eu rempli certaines exi- gences de bon cœur. Confus et déconcertés qu’ils étaient devant la futilité apparente de l’existence, ils ont vu les raisons profondes de leur difficulté de vivre. Mettant de côté la question de l’alcool, ils expliquent pourquoi leur vie était si insatisfaisante. Ils nous mon- trent comment le changement s’est produit en eux. Lorsque des centaines de gens peuvent affirmer que la conscience de la présence de Dieu est aujourd’hui ce qu’il y a de plus important dans leur vie, cela nous donne une puissante motivation de croire.
      Le monde qui nous entoure a fait plus de progrès sur le plan matériel au cours du dernier siècle que pen- dant tous les millénaires précédents. Presque tout le monde en connaît la raison. Ceux qui s’intéressent à l’histoire ancienne nous disent qu’intellectuellement, les hommes de l’Antiquité étaient égaux aux plus grands esprits de notre temps. Pourtant, dans les temps anciens, le progrès matériel était d’une lenteur pénible. Le développement scientifique, l’esprit de recherche et d’invention étaient presque inconnus. À l’égard des éléments physiques, l’esprit des hommes était entravé par des superstitions, des traditions et toutes sortes d’idées arrêtées. Au temps de Christophe Colomb, plu- sieurs trouvaient insensé de croire que la terre était ronde. D’autres ont failli condamner à mort le savant Galilée pour ses hérésies en matière d’astronomie.
      Nous nous sommes demandé : est-ce que certains d’entre nous n’étaient pas aussi bornés et irrationnels sur le plan spirituel que les gens de l’Antiquité l’avaient été dans le domaine matériel ? Même à notre siècle, les journaux américains ont hésité à publier un comp- te rendu du premier vol aérien par les frères Wright à Kitty Hawk. Toutes les tentatives précédentes pour voler n’avaient-elles pas échoué ? La machine volan- te du professeur Langley n’était-elle pas tombée au fond du Potomac ? Les meilleurs mathématiciens n’avaient-ils pas démontré que jamais l’homme ne pourrait voler ? Dieu n’avait-il pas dit que ce privi- lège appartenait aux oiseaux ? À peine trente ans plus tard, la conquête du ciel était presque devenue de l’his- toire ancienne et l’aviation était en plein essor.
      Dans la plupart des domaines, notre génération a été témoin d’une libération totale de la pensée. Montrez à un homme peu instruit un article du journal du dimanche où il est dit que l’on projette d’explorer la lune au moyen de fusées et il répondra : « Je parie qu’ils le feront, peut-être plus rapidement qu’on pense ». Notre époque n’est-elle pas caractérisée par la faci- lité avec laquelle nous remplaçons les idées anciennes par de nouvelles, par notre empressement à rejeter la théorie ou la chose qui ne fonctionne pas au profit de quelque chose de nouveau qui marche ?
      Nous avons dû nous demander pourquoi nous n’adopterions pas ce même empressement à changer notre point de vue face à nos problèmes humains. Nous avions des difficultés dans nos relations per- sonnelles, nous ne pouvions pas contrôler notre émo- tivité, nous étions en proie à la tristesse morbide et à la dépression, nous étions incapables de gagner notre vie, nous ne trouvions aucun but à l’existence, nous étions habités par la crainte, nous étions mal- heureux, nous ne croyions pas pouvoir faire quoi que ce soit pour les autres. Alors, n’était-il pas plus impor- tant de trouver un remède à long terme à nos frus- trations que de regarder les documentaires sur les vols vers la lune ? Évidemment.
      Lorsque nous en avons vu d’autres résoudre leurs problèmes simplement par leur confiance en l’Esprit de l’Univers, nous n’avons pas pu faire autrement que de ne plus douter de la puissance de Dieu. Nos idées ne menaient à rien. L’idée d’un Dieu fonctionnait.
      C’est leur foi ingénue qui amena les frères Wright à croire qu’ils pourraient construire une machine volan- te. Et ils réussirent. Sans cette confiance, ils n’auraient rien accompli. Nous, agnostiques et athées, demeurions convaincus que l’autosuffisance réglerait nos pro- blèmes. Lorsque d’autres nous ont montré qu’ils s’en étaient sortis par la puissance de Dieu, nous avons commencé à nous sentir comme ceux qui avaient prétendu que les frères Wright ne pourraient jamais voler.
      La logique est une grande chose. Elle nous plaisait et nous plaît encore. Ce n’est pas un hasard si nous avons reçu la faculté de raisonner, de remettre en ques- tion les messages de nos sens et de tirer des conclu- sions. C’est là un des merveilleux attributs de l’homme. Nous, qui sommes enclins à l’agnosticisme, nous ne serions pas satisfaits d’une proposition qui ne se prête pas à une étude et à une interprétation rationnelles. C’est pourquoi nous éprouvons de la difficulté à expli- quer pourquoi notre foi est rationnelle, pourquoi nous trouvons plus sain et plus logique de croire que de ne pas croire, et pourquoi nous disons que notre ancien- ne façon de penser était vague et sans consistance puis- qu’elle nous menait au doute et nous forçait à conclure : « Nous ne savons pas. »
      Lorsque nous sommes devenus alcooliques, brisés par un malheur auto-imposé impossible à retarder ou à éviter, nous avons dû courageusement faire face à un choix : ou Dieu est toute chose, ou Il n’est rien ; ou Dieu existe, ou Il n’existe pas. Quel serait ce choix ?
      À ce stade de notre démarche, nous étions carré- ment en face de la question de la foi. Nous ne pou- vions pas la contourner. Certains parmi nous étaient déjà bien engagés sur le Pont de la Raison, vers les rives souhaitées de la foi. La connaissance et la pro- messe d’un monde nouveau avait fait briller leurs yeux fatigués et redonné courage à leur cœur lan- guissant. Des mains amies s’étaient tendues. Nous étions reconnaissants à la raison de nous avoir conduits jusque-là. Et pourtant, nous n’étions pas complètement arrivés. Sans doute nous étions-nous trop fiés à notre raison pour cette dernière étape et l’idée de perdre cet appui nous déplaisait.
      Cette réaction était naturelle. Mais examinons la question de plus près. Sans que nous le sachions, n’était-ce pas une sorte de foi qui nous avait conduits là où nous étions ? N’avions-nous pas eu foi en notre propre raisonnement ? N’avions-nous pas eu confian- ce en notre faculté de penser ? Qu’était-ce cela, sinon une certaine foi ? Oui, nous avions cru, aveuglément cru, au Dieu de la Raison. Nous avons donc découvert que, d’une façon ou d’une autre, nous avions toujours été animés par la foi !
      Nous avons également découvert que nous avions été des adorateurs. Combien cet état mental nous don- nait la chair de poule ! N’avions-nous pas de diverses façons adoré des personnes, des objets, l’argent ou nous-mêmes ? Et puis, avec un motif plus noble, n’avions-nous pas admiré avec adoration un coucher de soleil, la mer ou une fleur ? Lequel parmi nous n’avait pas aimé quelque chose ou quelqu’un ? Quel rapport ces sentiments, ces amours, ces vénérations avaient-ils avec la raison pure ? Aucun ou bien peu, nous en prenions finalement conscience. Ces attitudes ne constituaient-elles pas la trame de nos vies ? Après tout, ces sentiments ne déterminaient-ils pas le cours de notre existence ? Nous ne pouvions pas dire que nous n’étions pas capables de croire, d’aimer ou d’ado- rer. Sous une forme ou une autre, nous avions vécu par la foi, presque uniquement.
      Imaginez la vie sans la foi ! Si seule la raison nous était laissée, la vie ne serait pas ce qu’elle est. D’ailleurs, nous croyions en la vie, nous y croyions ferme. Nous ne pouvions pas expliquer la vie de la même façon dont on peut démontrer que la ligne droite est le plus court chemin entre deux points et pour- tant, c’est la vérité. Pouvions-nous encore dire que tout cela n’était qu’une masse d’électrons issue du néant, n’ayant aucune signification, tourbillonnant sans fin vers le néant ? Bien sûr que non. Les électrons eux- mêmes semblaient plus intelligents que cela. Du moins, c’est ce qu’en disaient les chimistes.
      Nous avons donc vu que la raison n’était pas tout. Telle que nous l’utilisons, elle n’est pas non plus entiè- rement fiable, même lorsqu’elle émane des cerveaux les plus brillants. Nous pensons à ceux qui avaient prou- vé que l’homme ne pourrait jamais voler.
      Pourtant, nous avions assisté à un autre genre de décollage, celui d’une libération spirituelle de ce monde, de personnes qui se sont élevées au-dessus de leurs problèmes. C’était grâce à Dieu, disaient-ils, et nous nous sommes alors contentés de sourire. Nous avions été témoins d’une délivrance spirituelle mais nous préférions ne pas l’admettre.
      En fait, nous nous leurrions, car au plus profond de chaque être humain, homme, femme ou enfant, repo- se l’idée fondamentale de Dieu. Elle peut être masquée par le malheur, la vanité, le culte d’autres valeurs, mais elle est là, sous une forme ou sous une autre. La foi en une Puissance supérieure à nous-mêmes et les mani- festations miraculeuses de cette force dans la vie d’êtres humains sont des faits aussi anciens que l’homme lui- même.
      Finalement, nous avons découvert que la foi en Dieu, peu importe ce dieu, faisait partie de notre nature, comme les sentiments que nous éprouvons pour un ami. Parfois nous avons dû chercher en faisant taire nos craintes, mais Il était là. Son existence était aussi réelle que la nôtre. Nous avons découvert la Grande Réalité tout au fond de nous. En dernière analyse, c’est seule- ment là qu’on peut Le trouver. Ce fut notre expérience.
      Nous ne pouvons que dégager un peu la route. Si notre témoignage vous aide à vous débarrasser de vos préjugés, vous rend capables de réfléchir honnêtement, vous encourage à chercher vaillamment en vous, alors, si vous le voulez, vous pouvez vous joindre à nous sur la Grande Route. Si vous êtes ainsi disposé, vous ne pouvez pas échouer. Vous prendrez nécessairement conscience de votre foi.
      Vous trouverez dans ce livre l’histoire d’un homme qui se croyait athée. Son témoignage est tellement inté- ressant que nous devons en rapporter une partie dès maintenant. Sa métamorphose intérieure fut spectacu- laire, émouvante et convaincante.
      Notre ami était fils d’un pasteur. Il fréquentait l’école religieuse et il a fini pas se révolter contre ce qu’il consi- dérait être un excès d’enseignement religieux. Dans les années qui ont suivi, les ennuis et les frustrations se sont acharnés contre lui : faillite financière, folie, maladie mortelle, suicide, tous les malheurs dont sa famille immédiate a été frappée l’ont laissé déprimé et amer. Les désillusions de l’ après-guerre, l’ aggravation de son alcoolisme et la menace de la ruine mentale et physique ont amené cet homme vers l’autodestruction.
      Un soir, confiné à l’hôpital, il a reçu la visite d’un alcoolique qui avait vécu une expérience spirituelle. Dans un haut-le-cœur, il s’est écrié : « S’il y a un Dieu, il est certain qu’il n’a rien fait pour moi ! » Plus tard, seul dans sa chambre, il s’est demandé : « Les croyants peuvent-ils tous être dans l’erreur ? » Cette question lui faisait vivre les tortures de l’enfer. Puis, subitement, une pensée formidable lui a traversé l’es- prit comme un éclair, chassant tout le reste :
      « Quies-tupouraffirmerqueDieun’existepas ? »
      Cet homme nous a raconté qu’il était tombé à genoux à côté de son lit. En quelques secondes, il a été enva- hi par la conviction que Dieu était présent Il a ressenti comme une vague de certitude et de majesté déferler en lui et le submerger. Les barrières qu’il avait érigées pendant des années s’abattaient. Il se trouvait en pré- sence de la Puissance et de l’Amour infinis. Il avait traversé le pont vers le rivage. Pour la première fois, il avait conscience de la présence de son Créateur à ses côtés.
      Ainsi fut mise en place la pierre angulaire de la vie de notre ami. Aucune vicissitude ne l’a ébranlé. Son problème d’alcoolisme a été éliminé. Cette même nuit, il y a plusieurs années, il a disparu. Sauf à quelques occasions, l’idée de boire n’est plus jamais revenue ; dans ces moments-là, il a été pris d’une grande répul- sion. Apparemment, même s’il avait voulu, il n’aurait pas pu boire. Dieu lui avait rendu la raison.
      N’est-ce pas là une guérison miraculeuse ? Pourtant, les éléments en sont simples. Les circonstances l’ont amené à croire. Il s’est offert humblement à l’Auteur de ses jours, pui il a su.
      Nous aussi avons retrouvé la raison grâce à Dieu. Pour cet homme, la révélation a été soudaine. Pour d’autres, le changement est plus lent. Mais Il est venu à tous ceux qui L’ont cherché en toute honnêteté.
      Quand nous nous sommes approchés de Lui, Il s’est révélé à nous !

    - NOTRE MÉTHODE
    - "Rarement avons-nous vu faillir à la tâche celui qui s’est engagé à fond dans
      la même voie que nous. Ceux qui ne se rétablissent pas sont des gens qui ne
      peuvent pas ou ne veulent pas se soumettre com- plètement à ce simple programme.
      Ce sont d’habitude des hommes et des femmes qui sont naturellement inca- pables
      d’être honnêtes envers eux-mêmes. Il y en a de ces malheureux. Ce n’est pas
      leur faute, ils semblent être nés ainsi. Leur nature ne leur permet pas de com-
      prendre et de mettre en pratique une façon de vivre qui exige une rigoureuse
      honnêteté. Leurs chances de réus- sir se situent au-dessous de la moyenne. Il
      y a aussi ceux qui souffrent de graves désordres émotifs et men- taux ; mais
      plusieurs d’entre eux se rétablissent s’ils sont capables d’honnêteté.\r\nLes
      récits de nos vies révèlent, de façon générale, ce que nous étions, ce qui nous
      est arrivé et comment nous sommes maintenant. Si vous avez décidé que vous voulez
      ce que nous avons et que vous voulez tout faire pour l’obtenir, alors vous êtes
      prêts à prendre certaines mesures.\r\nDevant certaines de ces étapes, nous avons
      hésité. Nous avons cru pouvoir trouver une méthode plus faci- le, plus douce.
      Mais ce fut impossible. Avec toute l’ar- deur que nous avons, nous vous supplions
      d’être sans crainte et sincères dès le début. Certains d’entre nous ont tenté
      de s’accrocher à leurs vieilles idées, mais le résultat a été nul tant qu’ils
      ne se sont pas complète- ment abandonnés.\r\nN’oubliez pas que nous avons affaire
      à l’alcool, qui est puissant, déroutant, sournois ! Sans aide, c’est trop pour
      nous. Mais il y a un Être qui a tout pouvoir, et cet Être, c’est Dieu. Puissiez-vous
      Le découvrir main- tenant !\r\nLes demi-mesures ne nous ont rien donné. Nous
      nous trouvions à un tournant de notre vie. Nous avons demandé Sa protection
      et Son aide et nous nous sommes abandonnés à Lui complètement.\r\nVoici les
      étapes que nous avons suivies et que nous proposons comme programme de rétablissement
      :\r\n1. Nous avons admis que nous étions impuissants devant l’alcool — que nous
      avions perdu la maî- trise de notre vie.\r\n\t2.\tNous en sommes venus à croire
      qu’une Puis- sance supérieure à nous-mêmes pouvait nous rendre la raison. \r\n\t3.\tNous
      avons décidé de confier notre volonté et notre vie aux soins de Dieu tel que
      nous Le concevions. \r\n\t4.\tNous avons procédé sans crainte à un inventai-
      re moral, approfondi de nous-mêmes. \r\n\t5.\tNous avons avoué à Dieu, à nous-mêmes
      et à un autre être humain la nature exacte de nos torts. \r\n\t6.\tNous étions
      tout à fait prêts à ce que Dieu éli- mine tous ces défauts. \r\n\t7.\tNous Lui
      avons humblement demandé de faire disparaître nos défauts. \r\n\t8.\tNousavonsdresséunelistedetouteslespersonnes
      que nous avions lésées et nous avons consenti à réparer nos torts envers chacune
      d’elles. \r\n\t9.\tNous avons réparé nos torts directement envers ces personnes
      dans la mesure du possible, sauf lorsqu’en ce faisant, nous risquions de leur
      nuire \Lou de nuire à d’autres. \r\n\t10.\tNous avons poursuivi notre inventaire
      personnel \Let promptement admis nos torts dès que nous \Lnous en sommes aperçus.
      \r\n\t11.\tNous avons cherché par la prière et la médita- \Ltion à améliorer
      notre contact conscient avec Dieu, tel que nous Le concevions, Lui deman- dant
      seulement de connaître Sa volonté à notre égard et de nous donner la force de
      l’exécuter. \r\n\t12.\tAyant connu un réveil spirituel comme résultat de ces
      étapes, nous avons alors essayé de trans- mettre ce message à d’autres alcooliques
      et de mettre en pratique ces principes dans tous les domaines de notre vie.
      \r\nPlusieurs d’entre nous se sont exclamés : « C’est trop difficile ! Je ne
      pourrai pas y arriver. » Ne vous découragez pas. Personne d’entre nous n’a réussi
      à mettre en pratique ces principes à la perfection. Nous ne sommes pas des saints.
      Ce qui compte, c’est que nous sommes disposés à progresser selon des principes
      spirituels. Les principes que nous avons énoncés sont des guides vers la croissance.
      Nous parlons de crois- sance spirituelle plutôt que de perfection spirituelle.\r\nNotre
      description de l’alcoolique, le chapitre consa- cré aux agnostiques et nos aventures
      personnelles avant et après notre rétablissement font ressortir trois choses
      importantes :\r\na) Nous étions alcooliques et incapables de prendre notre vie
      en main.\r\n\r\nles alcooliques anonymes\r\nb) Probablement qu’aucune puissance
      humaine n’aurait pu nous délivrer de notre alcoolisme.\r\nc) Dieu pourrait le
      faire et le ferait si nous Le recherchions.\r\nDès lors convaincus, nous sommes
      arrivés à la Troi- sième Étape, celle de la décision de confier notre volon-
      té et notre vie aux soins de Dieu tel que nous Le concevions. Qu’entendons-nous
      par là et que faut-il faire ?\r\nLa première condition est d’avoir la conviction
      qu’une vie menée selon notre volonté personnelle peut difficilement être réussie.
      En agissant ainsi, nous entrons presque toujours en conflit avec quelque chose
      ou quelqu’un, même si nos intentions sont bonnes. La plupart des gens essaient
      de vivre en ne comptant que sur eux-mêmes. Chacun se comporte comme un acteur
      qui veut diriger tout le spectacle ; il essaie sans cesse de régler à sa façon
      l’éclairage, la chorégraphie, le décor, et de diriger les autres acteurs. Si
      seulement tout restait tel qu’il l’a voulu, si seulement les autres fai- saient
      ce qu’il souhaite, le spectacle serait un succès. Tout le monde, y compris lui-même,
      serait content. La vie serait magnifique. Dans ses efforts pour tout mettre
      en place, notre acteur peut parfois se montrer très ver- tueux. D’une part,
      il peut être bon, attentionné, patient, généreux, même humble et plein d’abnégation.
      D’autre part, il peut être mesquin, égoïste, infatué et malhon- nête. Comme
      la plupart des êtres humains, il est pro- bable qu’il a divers traits de caractère.\r\nQue
      se passe-t-il habituellement ? Le spectacle ne se déroule pas très bien. L’acteur
      commence à croire que la vie est injuste envers lui. Il décide de se forcer
      davantage. La fois suivante, il devient plus exigeant ou plus bienveillant,
      selon le cas. Mais la pièce ne le satis- fait toujours pas. Tout en reconnaissant
      sa part de res- ponsabilité, il est convaincu que les autres ont encore plus
      de torts. Il se fâche, s’indigne et s’apitoie sur son sort. Quel est son problème
      fondamental ? Ne recherche-t-il pas sa propre satisfaction, même lorsqu’il essaie
      d’être bon avec les autres ? N’est-il pas victi- me de l’illusion que l’on peut
      tirer bonheur et satis- faction de ce monde à la seule condition de savoir s’y
      prendre ? N’est-il pas évident pour le reste des acteurs que c’est à cela qu’il
      travaille ? Son attitude n’entraî- ne-t-elle pas les autres à se venger en retirant
      du spec- tacle tout ce qu’ils peuvent ? Même dans ses meilleurs moments, ne
      crée-t-il pas plus de confusion que d’har- monie ?\r\nNotre metteur en scène
      ne pense qu’à lui ou, pour employer un terme à la mode, c’est un égocentrique.
      Il est comme l’homme d’affaires à la retraite qui se prélasserait sous le soleil
      de la Floride en se plaignant de l’état pitoyable de la nation, comme le pasteur
      du culte qui soupirerait sur les péchés du XXe siècle, comme l’homme politique
      et le réformateur, convain- cus que la terre serait un paradis si seulement
      le reste du monde était meilleur ; comme le pilleur de coffres- forts qui trouverait
      que la société est injuste envers lui ; enfin, comme l’alcoolique qui a tout
      perdu et qui est enfermé. Quelles que soient nos protestations, ne sommes-nous
      pas, pour la plupart, tournés sur nous- mêmes, sur nos ressentiments ou notre
      apitoiement ?\r\nÉgoïsme et égocentrisme, c’est là, croyons-nous, la source
      de nos problèmes. Animés par une centai- ne de sortes de peurs, déçus de nous-mêmes,
      ne recherchant que nos intérêts et nous apitoyant sur notre sort, nous marchons
      sur les pieds de nos semblables et ils réagissent. Ils nous blessent parfois,
      appa- remment sans avoir été provoqués, mais invariable- ment, nous découvrons
      que dans le passé, nous avons pris une décision égoïste qui nous a exposés à
      être bles- sés plus tard.\r\nNous sommes donc les principaux artisans de nos
      malheurs. Ils viennent de nous, et l’alcoolique fournit l’exemple parfait de
      la volonté personnelle déchaînée, même si, la plupart du temps, il ne s’en rend
      pas comp- te. Avant toute chose, nous, les alcooliques, devons nous corriger
      de notre égoïsme, sinon il nous tuera ! Et avec Dieu, c’est possible. Il semble
      souvent que seule Son aide puisse nous libérer totalement de nous- mêmes. Nous
      étions nombreux à nous nourrir de toutes les convictions morales et philosophiques
      imaginables, et nous aurions bien aimé pouvoir vivre selon nos prin- cipes,
      mais nous en avons été incapables. Nous n’avons pas non plus réussi à réduire
      de beaucoup notre égo- centrisme par notre seul désir ou en comptant sur notre
      propre force. Il nous fallait l’aide de Dieu.\r\nVoilà le pourquoi et le comment
      de notre méthode. D’abord, nous avons dû cesser de jouer à Dieu car cela ne
      donnait rien. Nous avons ensuite décidé que doré- navant, Dieu serait le Metteur
      en scène de la pièce qu’est notre vie. Il est le Directeur et nous sommes ses
      agents. Il est le Père et nous sommes ses enfants. Ce concept, simple comme
      la plupart des bonnes idées, fut la clé de voûte de l’arche nouvelle et triomphante
      qui s’ouvrait sur notre liberté.\r\nAprès avoir adopté cette position en toute
      sincérité, toutes sortes de choses remarquables se sont produites. Nous avions
      un nouvel Employeur. Étant tout-puissant, Il pourvoyait à nos besoins à condition
      que nous restions près de Lui et que nous fassions bien Son travail. Bien établis
      dans notre nouvelle attitude, nous avons cessé progressivement de nous intéresser
      à notre moi, à nos petits projets et desseins personnels. De plus en plus, nous
      cherchions à apporter notre contribution à la vie. Au fur et à mesure que nous
      sentions en nous une force nouvelle, que la paix s’installait dans notre esprit,
      que la réussite de notre vie devenait chose possible, à mesure que nous devenions
      conscients de Sa présence, nous avons commencé à perdre notre peur d’aujourd’hui,
      de demain et de l’avenir. Nous naissions à nouveau.\r\nNous en étions alors
      à la Troisième Étape. Plusieurs d’entre nous ont adressé à notre Créateur, tel
      que nous Le concevions, la prière suivante : « Mon Dieu, je m’offre à vous pour
      que vous fassiez de moi et avec moi comme bon Vous semble. Délivrez-moi de l’es-
      clavage de l’égoïsme pour que je puisse mieux faire Votre volonté. Éloignez
      de moi les difficultés de sorte que ma victoire sur elles soit, pour ceux et
      celles que j’aurai aidés, un témoignage de Votre force, de Votre amour et de
      Votre mode de vie. Que j’accomplisse tou- jours votre volonté ! » Nous avons
      mûrement réfléchi avant de franchir cette étape car nous voulions être bien
      prêts ; nous voulions être sûrs qu’enfin, nous pouvions nous abandonner à Lui
      complètement.\r\nNous avons grandement souhaité faire cette étape spi- rituelle
      en compagnie d’une personne compréhensive comme notre femme, un ami intime ou
      notre guide spiri- tuel. Toutefois, mieux vaut la solitude pour rencontrer Dieu
      que la présence de quelqu’un qui pourrait ne pas comprendre. Bien sûr, les mots
      utilisés dans cette cir- constance importaient peu, mais l’idée devait être
      bien expriméeetcela,sansréserve.Cen’étaitqu’undébut ;si cet abandon était fait
      honnêtement et humblement, l’ef- fet, souvent très grand, se faisait sentir
      immédiatement.\r\nEnsuite, nous nous sommes lancés dans un vigoureux programme
      d’action dont la première phase consistait en un sérieux ménage intérieur, chose
      que nombre d’entre nous n’avions jamais tenté de faire. Toute vitale et cru-
      ciale que fut la décision de nous abandonner, elle ne pouvait avoir d’effet
      permanent sans être tout de suite suivie d’un gros effort pour faire face aux
      obstacles qui intérieurement nous avaient nui, et pour les éliminer. Notre problème
      d’alcool n’était qu’un symptôme. Nous devions donc nous attaquer aux causes.\r\nNous
      avons donc commencé par un inventaire per- sonnel. C’était la Quatrième Étape.
      Une entreprise dont on ne fait pas l’inventaire régulièrement est vouée à la
      faillite. Dresser un inventaire commercial consiste à recueillir des faits et
      à les examiner. On essaie de bien connaître les marchandises en stock. Un des
      buts de l’opération est de déterminer quelles sont les mar- chandises endommagées
      ou impropres à la vente, puis de s’en débarrasser rapidement et sans regret.
      Si un chef d’entreprise veut réussir, il ne doit pas se leurrer sur la valeur
      de son actif.\r\nC’est précisément ce que nous avons fait avec nos vies. Nous
      avons réuni les faits honnêtement. D’abord, nous avons cherché les faiblesses
      de notre personnali- té qui avaient causé notre faillite. Convaincus que notre
      moi, sous toutes ses formes, avait entraîné notre perte, nous avons étudié les
      façons dont il se manifestait le plus souvent.\r\nLe ressentiment est l’ennemi
      « n°1 ». Ce sentiment détruit plus d’alcooliques que toute autre chose. Il donne
      lieu à toutes les formes de maladies spirituelles car nous étions atteints non
      seulement mentalement et physiquement, mais spirituellement aussi. D’ailleurs,
      quand la maladie spirituelle n’y est plus, nous nous relevons physiquement et
      mentalement. Pour examiner nos ressentiments, nous avons inscrit ceux-ci sur
      une feuille. Nous avons dressé la liste des personnes, des institutions ou des
      principes qui suscitaient notre colè- re. Nous nous sommes demandé pourquoi
      nous étions fâchés. Nous avons trouvé que, la plupart du temps, nous nous sentions
      blessés ou menacés dans notre amour-propre, notre porte-monnaie, nos ambitions
      et nos relations personnelles (y compris sur le plan sexuel). Cela nous faisait
      souffrir et même enrager.\r\nSur la liste de nos ressentiments, nous avons aussi
      inscrit, vis-à-vis de chaque nom, la nature de notre bles- sure en nous demandant
      quel aspect de notre vie avait été atteint : notre amour-propre, notre sécurité,
      nos ambitions, nos relations personnelles, nos relations sexuelles ?\r\nEn général,
      notre description était aussi précise que la suivante :\r\nObjet de mon ressentiment
      M. Tremblay\r\nMme Leblanc\r\nMon employeur\r\nCause\r\nL’attention qu’il porte
      à ma femme\LA dit à ma femme que j’ avais une maîtresse. Pourrait prendre mon
      poste au bureau.\r\nElle est sotte. Elle m’a Regardé de haut.\LA fait interner
      son mari alcoolique.\r\nSon mari et moi sommes amis.\LC’est une commère. Manque
      de jugement. Injuste. Exigeant. Menace de me congédier parce que je bois et
      que je gonfle mes notes de frais.\r\nBlessure\r\nRelations sexuelles, amour-propre

      à\Lredire. Elle aime Tremblay. Elle V.eut la maison.\r\nBlessure\r\nOrgueil
      –\LVie sexuelle –Sécurité (peur).\r\nNous avons passé notre vie en revue. Rien
      n’avait plus d’importance que d’être précis et d’honnête. Puis, nous avons soigneusement
      analysé ce qui en ressortait. Nous avons d’abord remarqué que notre entourage
      et le monde entier avaient souvent tort. Nous n’étions jusque-là jamais allés
      plus loin que de conclure que les autres étaient fautifs. Il en résultait naturellement
      qu’ils continuaient de nous causer du tort et de nous irriter. Parfois, il nous
      arrivait d’avoir des remords, ce qui revient à dire que nous nous irritions
      contre nous- mêmes. Mais plus nous nous efforcions d’imposer nos volontés, plus
      les choses s’aggravaient. Comme à la guerre, le vainqueur ne l’était qu’en apparence.
      Nos moments de triomphe étaient brefs.\r\nUne chose est claire : celui qui vit
      dans le ressen- timent profond finit par mener une existence futile et malheureuse.
      Dans la mesure exacte où nous nous lais- sons aller à ce sentiment, nous gaspillons
      un temps pré- cieux qui autrement, pourrait être employé avec profit. Mais pour
      l’alcoolique, dont le salut dépend du main- tien et de l’évolution de son expérience
      spirituelle, le ressentiment est extrêmement grave. Il nous est même fatal car
      en cultivant notre rancune, nous nous coupons de la lumière de l’Esprit. La
      démence de l’alcool revient et nous recommençons à boire. Et pour nous, boire
      c’est mourir.\r\nSi nous voulions vivre, nous devions nous libérer de la colère.
      Les crises et l’irritabilité ne sont pas pour nous.\r\nLes gens normaux peuvent
      peut-être s’offrir ce luxe dou- teux mais pour les alcooliques, c’est un poison.\r\nNous
      sommes retournés à notre liste, car la clé de notre vie future s’y trouvait.
      Nous étions disposés à l’examiner dans un esprit totalement différent. Nous
      avons constaté que nous nous étions vraiment laissés dominer par le monde et
      par nos semblables. C’est pourquoi les travers des autres, qu’ils fussent réels
      ou imaginaires, pouvaient effectivement nous tuer. Com- ment échapper au danger
      ? Il était clair que nous devions dominer nos ressentiments. Mais comment y
      parvenir ? Pas plus que pour l’alcool, nous ne pou- vions nous contenter d’espérer
      qu’ils disparaîtraient.\r\nVoici ce que nous avons fait. Nous nous sommes rendu
      compte que ceux qui nous avaient causé du tort pouvaient être malades spirituellement.
      Même si leurs symptômes et les ennuis qu’ils nous causaient nous irri- taient,
      ils étaient tout comme nous, des malades. Nous avons demandé à Dieu de nous
      aider à leur démontrer la même tolérance, la même pitié et la même patien- ce
      que nous aurions été heureux de témoigner à un ami malade. Lorsqu’une personne
      nous blessait, nous nous disions : « Elle est malade. Que puis-je faire pour
      l’ai- der ? Mon Dieu, gardez-moi de la colère. Que Votre volonté soit faite.
      »\r\nNous évitions la vengeance et les disputes, comme nous l’aurions fait avec
      une personne malade. Si nous n’avions pas agi ainsi, nous aurions perdu nos
      chances de nous rendre utiles. Nous ne pouvons pas venir en aide à tout le monde,
      mais au moins, grâce à Dieu, nous apprenons à être bons et tolérants envers
      tout un chacun.\r\nNous sommes revenus à notre liste. En ne tenant pas compte
      des torts des autres envers nous, nous avons résolu d’examiner nos propres fautes.
      Dans quels cas avions-nous été égoïstes, malhonnêtes, calculateurs et effrayés
      ? En face d’une situation donnée dont nous n’étions pas entièrement responsables,
      nous tentions de faire totalement abstraction de l’autre personne en cause.
      Étions-nous à blâmer ? Nous faisions notre inventaire à nous, pas celui de l’autre.
      Quand nous constations nos fautes, nous les prenions en note. Elles étaient
      là, écrites noir sur blanc. Après avoir honnête- ment reconnu nos torts, nous
      avons consenti à les redresser.\r\nRemarquez que le mot « peur » est entre paren-
      thèses dans les quatre cas : M. Tremblay, Mme Leblanc, l’employeur et la conjointe.
      Ce petit mot affecte d’une certaine façon presque tous les aspects de notre
      vie. La peur était comme un fil mauvais et pourri, la trame sur laquelle nos
      existences étaient tis- sées. Elle a engendré des situations qui nous ont causé
      des malheurs que nous ne croyions pas avoir mérités. Mais n’avions-nous pas
      été à l’origine de tout cela ? Il nous arrive parfois de penser que la peur
      est aussi grave que le vol ; elle semble même entraîner plus d’ ennuis.\r\nNous
      avons soigneusement passé en revue toutes nos craintes en les écrivant, même
      si aucun ressentiment n’y était rattaché. Nous nous sommes interrogés sur la
      cause de nos peurs. N’était-ce pas parce que notre auto- suffisance nous avait
      lâchés ? L’autosuffisance nous avait servis jusqu’à un certain point, mais pas
      encore assez. Certains parmi nous avaient déjà eu une grande confiance en eux-mêmes
      mais cela n’avait pas suffi pour venir à bout de leurs peurs et autres difficultés.
      Lorsque notre peur nous rendait suffisants, c’était enco- re pire.\r\nNous croyons
      qu’il existe peut-être une meilleure méthode car maintenant nous avons d’autres
      assises : la confiance en Dieu et l’abandon à Ses soins. Plutôt que de nous
      fier à notre moi limité, nous faisons confiance à un Dieu infini. Nous sommes
      dans le monde pour tenir le rôle qu’Il nous a assigné. Dans la mesu- re où nous
      faisons ce que nous croyons qu’Il veut et où, humblement, nous nous en remettons
      à Lui, Il nous aide à accepter les calamités avec sérénité.\r\nJamais nous ne
      nous excusons auprès de quiconque de dépendre de notre Créateur. Nous pouvons
      faire fi de ceux qui considèrent la spiritualité comme la voie de la faiblesse.
      Au contraire, elle est plutôt la voie de la force. L’histoire a démontré que
      la foi est synony- me de courage. Tous les hommes de foi ont du cou- rage. Ils
      ont confiance en leur Dieu. En aucun cas nous n’avons à nous excuser à cause
      de Dieu. Nous Le lais- sons plutôt démontrer, à travers nous, ce qu’Il peut
      faire. Nous Lui demandons de nous libérer de notre peur et de nous faire voir
      ce qu’Il attend de nous. Dès lors, nous sentons la crainte nous quitter.\r\nVenons-en
      maintenant à la question sexuelle. Plu- sieurs d’entre nous avaient besoin d’une
      réforme dans ce domaine. Mais avant tout, nous avons tâché de faire preuve de
      bon sens sur cette question, car il est très facile de s’égarer. C’est un point
      sur lequel les opi- nions sont parfois diamétralement opposées, et vont peut-être
      à des extrêmes absurdes. D’une part, il y a ceux pour qui les relations sexuelles
      ne font que satis- faire les bas instincts et sont nécessaires pour procréer.
      D’autre part, il y a ceux qui en redemandent toujours davantage ; ils s’en prennent
      à l’institution du maria- ge ; ils considèrent que la plupart des problèmes
      du genre humain sont, au fond, des problèmes d’ordre sexuel. Ils croient que
      leurs relations ne sont pas assez fréquentes ou qu’elles ne sont pas bonnes.
      Tout leur semble relever de la vie sexuelle. Pour les uns, le piment de la vie
      devrait être interdit, pour les autres, seul le piment devrait compter. Nous
      ne voulons pas entrer dans cette controverse. Nous ne voulons pas arbi- trer
      la conduite sexuelle de quiconque. Nous avons tous des problèmes de sexualité.
      Nous ne serions pas tout à fait humains si nous n’en avions pas. Mais comment
      les résoudre ?\r\nNous avons analysé notre conduite des années pas- sées. Quand
      avions-nous fait preuve d’égoïsme, de mal- honnêteté ou de manque de considération
      ? Qui avions-nous blessé ? Avions-nous inutilement suscité la jalousie, la méfiance
      ou la rancune ? Où étaient nos erreurs et qu’aurions-nous dû faire à la place
      ? Nous avons tout inscrit sur une feuille et nous avons exa- miné le résultat.\r\nEn
      agissant ainsi, nous avons tenté de nous tracer pour l’avenir un idéal de vie
      sexuelle sensé et réaliste. Pour chaque relation, nous nous sommes posé la question
      sui- vante : avions-nous été égoïstes ou non ? Nous avons demandé à Dieu de
      nous façonner un idéal et de nous aider à nous y conformer. Toujours, nous gardions
      à l’esprit que nos facultés sexuelles nous ont été données par Dieu et que,
      par conséquent, elles ne pouvaient pas être mauvaises ; nous ne pouvions pas
      non plus en user à la légère ou égoïstement, pas plus que nous devions les mépriser
      ou les avoir en aversion.\r\nQuel que soit l’idéal adopté, nous devons toujours
      tendre à nous en approcher pour grandir. Nous devons être prêts à réparer les
      torts que nous avons causés pourvu que cette réparation ne cause pas des torts
      plus graves encore. En d’autres mots, nous traitons la question sexuelle comme
      toutes les autres. Dans nos méditations, nous demandons à Dieu ce que nous devons
      faire devant chaque situation spécifique. La bonne réponse nous sera donnée
      si nous le désirons.\r\nDieu seul peut juger notre vie sexuelle. Souvent nous
      aimions prendre conseil auprès d’ autres personnes, mais nous laissons Dieu
      être le dernier juge. Nous avons constaté qu’autant certaines personnes sont
      fana- tiques pour tout ce qui a trait au sexe, autant d’autres sont sans limites.
      Nous évitons les points de vue extrêmes ou les conseils excessifs.\r\nSupposons
      que nous manquions à notre idéal. Allons- nous aller boire pour autant ? Certains
      sont de cet avis. Mais ce n’est qu’une demi-vérité. Tout dépend de nous et de
      nos motifs. Si nous regrettons notre erreur et que nous avons le désir sincère
      de laisser Dieu nous gui- der vers des choses meilleures, nous croyons que nous
      serons pardonnés et que nous aurons appris notre leçon. Si nous n’éprouvons
      aucun regret et que notre condui- te continue de léser les autres, il est à
      peu près sûr que nous recommencerons à boire. Nous ne faisons pas de la théorie.
      Nous nous fondons sur des faits tirés de notre expérience.\r\nRésumons : en
      matière de vie sexuelle, nous prions ardemment pour le juste idéal, la ligne
      de conduite à suivre dans chaque situation critique, le bon sens et la force
      de faire ce qui est bien. Si notre vie sexuelle nous cause de graves ennuis,
      nous nous mettons encore plus au service des autres. Nous pensons à leurs besoins
      et tâchons de les aider à les combler. Cela nous force à nous oublier. Le don
      de soi calme les désirs impérieux dont la satisfaction entraînait de la souffrance.\r\nSi
      vraiment nous avons fait un inventaire exhaustif, nous avons beaucoup écrit.
      Nous avons énuméré et analysé nos ressentiments. Nous avons commencé à comprendre
      leur futilité et le danger mortel qu’ils repré- sentaient. Nous avons commencé
      à voir combien ils sont terriblement destructeurs. Nous avons commencé à apprendre
      ce que sont la tolérance, la patience et la bonne volonté envers nos semblables,
      même envers nos ennemis, que nous avons vus comme des êtres malades. Nous avons
      fait la liste des personnes que notre condui- te a blessées et nous nous sommes
      disposés à réparer, si possible, le tort que nous avons causé dans le passé.\r\nDans
      ce livre, vous avez lu maintes et maintes fois que la foi a fait pour nous ce
      que nous ne pouvions pas faire pour nous-mêmes. Nous espérons vous avoir convaincus
      que Dieu peut vous libérer de toute forme de volonté personnelle, de ce qui
      vous isolait de Lui. Si déjà vous avez pris une décision et que vous avez fait
      un inventaire de vos fautes les plus graves, vous êtes bien parti. Ainsi, vous
      avez absorbé et digéré quelques grosses vérités sur vous-même.\r\n"

    - "Notre inventaire personnel étant pris, que nous reste-t-il à faire maintenant
      ? Nous avons essayé d’adopter une nouvelle attitude envers notre Créateur, de
      vivre une nouvelle relation avec Lui et de découvrir les obstacles sur notre
      route. Nous avons admis avoir certains défauts ; nous avons, en gros, cerné
      le problème ; grâce à notre inventaire, nous avons identifié nos points faibles.
      Nous sommes main- tenant sur le point d’en être libérés. Mais pour y par- venir,
      il faut une action qui, si nous la menons jusqu’au bout, nous amènera à admettre
      la nature exacte de nos torts à Dieu, à nous-mêmes et à un autre être humain.
      Cela nous amène à la Cinquième Étape du programme de rétablissement dont nous
      avons parlé au chapitre précédent.\r\nCette étape peut être difficile, particulièrement
      lors- qu’il s’agit de discuter de nos défauts avec une autre personne. On pourrait
      croire que se les admettre à soi- même est bien assez. Mais nous avons des doutes
      à ce sujet. Dans la pratique, nous trouvons, en général, l’au- toévaluation
      solitaire insuffisante. Beaucoup ont cru nécessaire d’aller plus loin. Nous
      acceptons plus faci- lement de parler de nous-mêmes avec une autre per- sonne
      si nous voyons de bonnes raisons de le faire. D’abord, la première et la meilleure
      : si nous brûlons cette étape vitale, nous pourrions ne jamais surmonter notre
      problème d’alcool. Combien de fois les nouveaux n’ont-ils pas tenté de cacher
      certains faits de leur vie ! Essayant de se soustraire à cette expérience humilian-
      te, ils ont eu recours à des méthodes plus faciles et, presque invariablement,
      ils ont bu. Comme ils avaient suivi le reste du programme, ils se sont demandé
      pour- quoi ils avaient rechuté. Nous croyons que c’est parce qu’ils n’avaient
      pas fini leur ménage intérieur. Ils avaient bien passé leur vie en revue, mais
      ils avaient omis les points les plus accablants. Ils s’imaginaient seulement
      être libérés de leur égoïsme et de leur crain- te ; ils s’imaginaient seulement
      avoir montré de l’hu- milité. Ils n’en avaient pas encore appris assez sur l’humilité,
      la confiance et l’honnêteté tels que nous les considérons nécessaires, tant
      qu’ils n’avaient pas dévoi- lé toute l’histoire de leur vie à quelqu’un.\r\nPlus
      que la plupart des gens, l’alcoolique mène une double vie. Il est un grand comédien.
      Il présente à la face du monde son personnage de scène, celui qu’il aime montrer
      à son entourage. Il cherche à se créer une certaine réputation en sachant au
      fond de lui-même que ce n’est pas celle qu’il mérite.\r\nL’écart entre sa réputation
      et sa conduite s’aggrave encore en état d’ébriété. Lorsqu’il reprend ses sens,
      les quelques faits qui lui reviennent vaguement en mémoi- re le révoltent. Ces
      souvenirs sont un cauchemar pour lui. L’idée que quelqu’un ait pu le voir dans
      cet état le fait trembler. Aussi vite qu’il le peut, il chasse ces pensées loin
      au fond de lui-même en espérant qu’elles ne referont jamais surface. Il est
      constamment en proie à la crainte et à la tension, et cela le pousse à boire
      davantage.\r\nLes psychologues ont tendance à partager notre avis. Nous avons
      dépensé des milliers de dollars en examens médicaux ; dans de rares cas seulement
      avons-nous donné aux médecins qui nous traitaient une chance de nous aider.
      Nous leur avons rarement dit toute la véri- té, pas plus que nous n’avons suivi
      leurs conseils. Peu disposés à être honnêtes avec ces hommes compatis- sants,
      nous ne l’étions pas davantage avec les autres. Pas étonnant que tant de membres
      de la profession médicale aient une piètre opinion des alcooliques et doutent
      de leurs chances de se rétablir !\r\nNous devons être parfaitement honnêtes
      avec quel- qu’un si nous voulons vivre longtemps ou heureux ici- bas. Naturellement
      – et c’est légitime – nous réfléchissons longuement avant de choisir la ou les
      per- sonnes avec qui nous allons franchir cette étape inti- me et confidentielle.
      Ceux qui pratiquent une religion où la confession est obligatoire voudront nécessaire-
      ment s’adresser à l’autorité désignée pour faire entendre ces révélations. Même
      si nous ne sommes rattachés à aucune foi particulière, nous avons intérêt à
      nous confier à un prêtre d’une religion reconnue. Souvent, une telle personne
      cerne vite notre problème et le com- prend. Certes, il nous arrive quelquefois
      de rencontrer des gens qui ne comprennent pas les alcooliques.\r\nSi nous ne
      pouvons ou ne désirons pas de cette solu- tion, nous cherchons un ami discret
      et compréhensif. Cet ami peut être notre médecin ou notre psychologue. Il peut
      également se trouver dans notre propre famil- le, mais nous ne pouvons pas dévoiler
      à notre femme ou à nos parents des choses qui les blesseraient ou les rendraient
      malheureux. Nous n’avons pas le droit de sauver notre peau au détriment d’une
      autre personne. Nous faisons ces confidences à quelqu’un qui va com- prendre
      mais qui n’en sera pas affecté. Si la règle nous impose d’être durs avec nous-mêmes,
      elle nous deman- de d’être toujours pleins d’égards pour les autres.\r\nMalgré
      la grande nécessité de se livrer à quelqu’un, il peut arriver qu’un individu
      soit dans une situation telle qu’il n’y ait personne qui lui convienne. En pareil
      cas, cette étape peut être reportée, à condition toute- fois que l’alcoolique
      reste disposé à se confier entiè- rement dès que l’occasion se présentera. Nous
      le mentionnons parce qu’il est très important que chacun puisse s’adresser à
      la bonne personne. Il est tout aussi essentiel que cette dernière soit capable
      de garder des confidences, qu’elle comprenne et approuve entière- ment notre
      démarche, qu’elle n’essaie pas de changer nos projets. En revanche, nous ne
      devons pas utiliser cela comme un prétexte pour remettre l’étape à plus tard.\r\nUne
      fois que nous avons choisi qui recevra nos confi- dences, nous ne perdons pas
      de temps. Nous avons en mains notre inventaire écrit et nous sommes prêts à
      parler longtemps. Nous expliquons à notre partenaire ce que nous nous apprêtons
      à faire et pourquoi nous devons le faire. La personne doit comprendre qu’il
      s’agit pour nous d’une question de vie ou de mort. Lorsque nous présentons les
      choses de cette façon, la plupart des gens acceptent avec plaisir de nous aider
      ; ils se sentent honorés de recevoir nos confidences.\r\nNous mettons notre
      orgueil de côté et nous y allons de nos secrets en explicitant bien chaque repli
      de notre caractère, chaque coin et recoin de notre passé. Une fois que, sans
      avoir rien caché, nous avons franchi cette étape, nous sommes enchantés. Nous
      pouvons regarder le monde en face. Lorsque nous sommes seuls, nous nous sentons
      en paix et parfaitement à l’aise. Nos craintes nous quittent. Nous commençons
      à sentir la présence immédiate de notre Créateur. Nous avions peut-être jusque-là
      des convictions spirituelles, mais maintenant nous commençons à vivre une expérience
      spirituelle. Cette expérience est souvent accompagnée de l’impression très vive
      que notre problème d’alcool a disparu. Nous avons l’impression d’être sur la
      Gran- de Route, marchant main dans la main avec l’Esprit de l’ univers.\r\nDe
      retour à la maison, nous nous retirons dans un endroit paisible pendant une
      heure pour réfléchir soi- gneusement à ce que nous venons de faire. Nous remer-
      cions Dieu du fond du cœur pour nous avoir permis de mieux Le connaître. Reprenant
      ce livre, nous allons à la page où sont énumérées les Douze Étapes. Nous relisons
      attentivement les cinq premiers points, nous essayons de voir si nous n’aurions
      pas omis quelque chose car nous construisons une arche que nous allons traverser
      pour devenir enfin un être libre. La construc- tion est-elle solide ? Les pierres
      sont-elles bien en place ? Avons-nous lésiné sur les matériaux de la fon- dation
      ? Avons-nous essayé de fabriquer du mortier sans sable ?\r\nSi nous pouvons
      répondre de façon satisfaisante à ces questions, alors nous passons à la Sixième
      Étape. Nous avons déjà dit et répété que la bonne volonté est indispensable.
      Sommes-nous prêts maintenant à laisser Dieu nous enlever toutes les choses que
      nous avions reconnues comme répréhensibles en nous ? Peut-Il maintenant les
      prendre toutes et chacune ? Si nous nous accrochons encore à quelque chose dont
      nous ne voulons pas nous départir, nous demandons à Dieu de nous aider à y renoncer.\r\nQuand
      nous sommes prêts, nous Lui disons quelque chose qui ressemble à ceci : « Mon
      Créateur, je suis maintenant disposé à ce que Vous preniez tout ce que je suis,
      bon ou mauvais. Je Vous demande d’ôter de moi chacun des défauts qui m’empêche
      de Vous être utile, à Vous et à mes semblables. Accordez-moi la force de faire
      Votre volonté à partir de maintenant. Ainsi soit-il. » Nous venons de faire
      la Septième Étape.\r\nNous devons encore demeurer dans l’action, sans quoi nous
      découvrirons que « la foi sans les œuvres est une foi morte ». Jetons un coup
      d’œil à la Huitiè- me et à la Neuvième Étape. Nous avons la liste de toutes
      les personnes que nous avons lésées et envers qui nous sommes prêts à réparer
      nos torts. Nous avons dressé cette liste au moment de notre inventaire et à
      cette occasion, nous nous étions soumis à un examen sévère. Maintenant nous
      allons vers nos semblables dans le but de réparer le dommage fait dans le passé.
      Nous tentons de réparer les dégâts que nous avons cau- sés en voulant imposer
      nos volontés et diriger nous- mêmes le spectacle. Si nous n’avons pas la force
      de le faire, nous prions jusqu’à ce qu’elle nous soit donnée. Souvenez-vous
      qu’il était entendu au début que nous ne reculerions devant rien pour vaincre
      l’alcool.\r\nSans doute reste-t-il encore quelques réticences. En récapitulant
      la liste des amis et des compagnons de travail que nous avons blessés, il pourrait
      arriver que nous soyons peu confiants des résultats d’une démarche à caractère
      spirituel auprès d’eux. Rassu- rons-nous. Il n’est pas nécessaire, et probablement
      pas indiqué, d’aborder certaines personnes en insistant sur le caractère spirituel
      de notre visite. Nous pourrions éveiller des préjugés chez elles. Pour l’instant,
      nous tentons de mettre de l’ordre dans notre vie. Cela ne constitue cependant
      pas une fin en soi. Notre but véri- table est de nous préparer à nous mettre
      en état de servir le plus possible Dieu et les personnes qui nous entourent.
      Il est rarement sage, en revenant vers un individu encore affecté par les injustices
      que nous lui avons fait subir, de lui annoncer que nous sommes désormais tournés
      vers la religion. Dans l’arène, cela équivaudrait à foncer sans penser aux conséquences.
      Pourquoi nous exposer à nous faire traiter de fana- tiques ou de raseurs religieux
      ? Nous pourrions gâcher toute chance éventuelle de livrer un message positif.
      Par ailleurs, notre interlocuteur ne pourra qu’être impressionné par notre désir
      sincère de réparer le tort que nous lui avons causé. Il sera plus intéressé
      par notre démonstration de bonne volonté que par le récit de nos découvertes
      spirituelles.\r\nIl ne s’agit cependant pas d’un prétexte pour échap- per à
      la peur de parler de Dieu. Nous sommes prêts à exposer nos convictions avec
      tact et bon sens quand c’est utile. La question de notre démarche auprès de
      quelqu’un que nous avons détesté va surgir à son heure. Peut-être cette personne
      nous a-t-elle causé plus de tort que nous ne lui en avons fait ; en dépit de
      meilleurs sentiments envers elle, nous ne sommes pas très enthousiastes à l’idée
      d’admettre nos torts. Avec une personne qui nous est antipathique, nous devons
      tout de même prendre sur nous. Il est plus difficile d’aller vers un ennemi
      que vers un ami, mais cela nous rap- porte davantage. Nous abordons alors l’autre
      dans un esprit d’aide et de pardon, nous avouons notre inimi- tié passée et
      exprimons notre regret.\r\nNous évitons à tout prix de critiquer cette personne
      ou de discuter avec elle. Nous lui disons simplement que nous ne pourrons pas
      surmonter notre problème d’alcool tant que nous n’aurons pas fait tout notre
      pos- sible pour mettre de l’ordre dans notre passé. Nous sommes là pour réparer
      les dégâts dont nous sommes responsables, conscients que nous ne pourrons rien
      faire de valable tant que le passé n’aura pas été nettoyé. Nous évitons de lui
      dire ce qu’elle devrait faire. Seuls nos torts à nous sont mentionnés, jamais
      les siens. Si nous parlons avec calme, franchise et sans rien cacher, les résultats
      seront satisfaisants.\r\nNeuf fois sur dix, l’inattendu se produit. Notre inter-
      locuteur avoue parfois ses propres fautes et l’inimitié vieille de plusieurs
      années s’efface en une heure. Nous réussissons presque toujours à marquer des
      progrès. Il arrive que nos ennemis d’hier nous félicitent pour notre démarche
      et nous souhaitent bonne chance. Parfois, cer- tains nous offrent leur aide.
      Il ne faut cependant pas nous en faire si quelqu’un nous chasse de son bureau.
      Nous aurons démontré notre bonne volonté, nous aurons fait ce qu’il fallait.
      C’est fini.\r\nLa plupart des alcooliques doivent de l’argent. Nous ne cherchons
      pas à échapper à nos créanciers. Nous leur expliquons notre objectif sans faire
      de manières au sujet de notre alcoolisme. En général, ils sont déjà au courant,
      que nous nous en doutions ou non. Nous ne craignons pas non plus de révéler
      notre problème d’alcool sous prétexte que notre franchise pourrait nous causer
      des ennuis financiers. Abordé sans détours, le plus dur des créanciers peut
      parfois nous surprendre. Tout en discu- tant du meilleur arrangement possible,
      nous laissons savoir à ces gens que nous regrettons notre conduite pas- sée.
      Notre alcoolisme a fait de nous de mauvais payeurs. Nous ne devons pas craindre
      nos créanciers, aussi loin que cela doive nous mener, car l’angoisse d’avoir
      à leur faire face risque de nous faire boire.\r\nIl se peut que nous ayons commis
      un acte criminel pour lequel nous pourrions être mis en prison s’il était connu
      des autorités. Peut-être le manque d’argent nous empêche de nous racheter. Nous
      avons déjà avoué ces circonstances à une autre personne, confidentiellement.
      Cependant, si ces gestes étaient révélés, nous serions certainement incarcérés
      ou nous perdrions notre emploi. Dans d’autres cas, il peut s’agir seulement
      d’un délit mineur, comme d’avoir gonflé nos notes de frais. La plupart d’entre
      nous avons fait des choses de ce genre. Divorcés et remariés, peut-être avons-nous
      cessé de verser la pension à notre première femme. Furieuse, elle a fait délivrer
      un mandat d’arrestation contre nous. C’est là une forme d’ennuis également répandue.\r\nBien
      que nous puissions réparer ces torts d’innom- brables façons, certains principes
      généraux peuvent nous guider. En nous rappelant que nous avons déci- dé d’aller
      aussi loin qu’il le faudrait pour vivre une expérience spirituelle, nous demandons
      que nous soient données la force et la lumière nécessaires pour faire ce qu’il
      faut, quelles que soient les conséquences pour nous. Cela peut signifier la
      perte de notre emploi ou de notre réputation, ou même l’incarcération, mais
      nous sommes prêts à tout. Il le faut. Nous ne devons recu- ler devant rien.\r\nEn
      général, d’autres personnes sont mêlées à nos his- toires. Nous prendrons garde
      de ne pas jouer le rôle du martyr qui, dans un geste aussi précipité qu’incon-
      sidéré, sacrifierait inutilement les autres pour échapper au piège de l’alcoolisme.
      Nous connaissons un homme qui s’était remarié. À cause de l’alcool et par ressen-
      timent, il ne payait pas de pension alimentaire à sa pre- mière femme. Elle
      en était furieuse. Elle s’est présentée à la cour et l’a fait incriminer. Il
      avait commencé à vivre selon nos principes, il possédait un bon emploi et commençait
      à sortir la tête de l’eau. Il aurait fait preuve d’un héroïsme impressionnant
      s’il s’était pré- senté devant le juge en disant : « Me voici. »\r\nNous étions
      d’avis qu’il devait se montrer disposé à le faire si nécessaire. Seulement,
      une fois emprisonné, il ne pourrait plus pourvoir aux besoins d’aucune de ses
      deux familles. Nous lui avons suggéré d’envoyer à sa première femme une lettre
      dans laquelle il admet- tait ses fautes et demandait pardon. Il a envoyé la
      lettre en y ajoutant une petite somme d’argent. Il lui disait aussi ce qu’il
      s’efforcerait de faire à l’avenir. Il a ajou- té qu’il serait prêt à aller en
      prison si elle y tenait. Bien sûr elle a renoncé à ses poursuites, et la situation
      est depuis longtemps rentrée dans l’ordre.\r\nAvant de prendre des mesures radicales
      qui pour- raient engager d’autres personnes, nous nous assurons du consentement
      de celles-ci. Après que la permission nous a été accordée, que nous avons pris
      conseil auprès d’autres personnes et que nous avons demandé l’aide de Dieu,
      si la mesure catégorique s’impose, alors nous ne devons pas reculer.\r\nCela
      nous fait penser à l’expérience de l’un de nos amis. Du temps où il prenait
      un verre, il avait accep- té, sans donner de reçu, une somme d’argent d’un homme
      d’affaires et rival qu’il détestait. Par la suite, il a nié avoir reçu l’argent
      et s’est servi de cet inci- dent pour discréditer son ennemi. Il utilisait donc
      ses propres méfaits pour détruire la réputation d’un autre homme. Et, effectivement,
      son rival fut ruiné.\r\nIl avait le sentiment d’avoir causé un tort qu’il serait
      incapable de redresser. S’il ramenait cette affaire sur le tapis, il risquait
      de détruire la réputation de son asso- cié, d’exposer sa famille à la disgrâce
      et d’être privé de son gagne-pain. Avait-il le droit de mêler à son his- toire
      toutes les personnes qui dépendaient de lui ? Comment pouvait-il s’y prendre
      pour blanchir publi- quement son rival ? Après avoir consulté sa femme et son
      associé, il en vint à la conclusion qu’il valait mieux prendre tous ces risques
      que de se tenir pour coupable de cette diffa- mation devant son Créateur. Il
      a constaté qu’il devait s’en remettre à Dieu quant à l’issue de cette affaire
      sinon, il recommencerait à boire et tout serait perdu de toute façon. Il s’est
      rendu à l’église pour la première fois depuis des années. Après le sermon, il
      s’est levé tranquillement et a exposé la situation à l’assistance. Il s’est
      ainsi attiré l’approbation générale ; aujourd’hui, c’est un des citoyens les
      plus respectés de sa ville. Tout cela s’est passé il y a longtemps.\r\nIl est
      probable que nous ayons des problèmes de ménage. Peut-être entretenons-nous
      avec les femmes des relations dont nous préférons que la nature ne soit pas
      connue. Sur ce point, nous doutons que les alcoo- liques soient fondamentalement
      bien pires que les autres. Quoi qu’il en soit, il est certain que boire com-
      plique les relations sexuelles avec le conjoint. Après quelques années aux côtés
      d’un alcoolique, une femme s’use, devient amère et incapable de communiquer.
      Comment pourrait-il en être autrement ? Le mari com- mence à se sentir seul
      et à s’apitoyer sur son sort. Il se met à chercher quelque chose d’autre que
      l’alcool dans les boîtes de nuit ou autres endroits du même genre. Peut-être
      vit-il une aventure secrète passionnée avec une « femme qui comprend » ? En
      toute honnêteté, nous devons dire qu’elle peut très bien comprendre. Mais que
      faire devant une situation comme celle-ci ? Souvent, celui dont c’est le cas
      éprouve de gros remords, surtout s’il est marié à une femme loyale et courageuse
      qui a vécu et vit littéralement l’enfer à cause de lui.\r\nQuelle que soit la
      situation, nous devons générale- ment faire quelque chose pour la corriger.
      Si nous sommes certains que notre femme ne sait rien, devons- nous lui dire
      ce qui se passe ? Pas nécessairement. Si, dans l’ensemble, elle sait que nous
      avons fait bien des folies, devons-nous lui en raconter les détails ? Certes,
      nous devons avouer nos fautes. Elle peut cependant insister pour avoir tous
      les détails. Elle voudra savoir qui est l’autre femme et où elle habite. Nous
      considé- rons qu’il vaut mieux répondre que nous n’avons pas le droit de mêler
      une autre personne à nos problèmes de couple, que nous regrettons ce que nous
      avons fait et que, si Dieu le veut, cette situation ne se représen- tera pas.
      Nous ne pouvons pas faire plus ; nous n’avons pas le droit d’aller plus loin.
      Même s’il y a parfois des exceptions légitimes et bien que nous ne voulions
      pas tracer de règle à suivre, nous avons souvent trouvé que c’était là la meilleure
      façon de procéder.\r\nNotre mode de vie n’est pas à sens unique. Il est aussi
      bon pour la femme que pour le mari. Si les hommes sont capables d’oublier, les
      femmes le peu- vent aussi. Toutefois, il vaut mieux ne pas révéler inuti- lement
      l’identité d’une personne sur qui, par la suite, notre femme pourrait décharger
      sa jalousie.\r\nDans certains cas, c’est peut-être la franchise la plus totale
      qui est de rigueur. Une tierce personne ne peut pas toujours évaluer ces situations
      intimes. Il peut arriver que les deux conjoints, préférant laisser parler la
      raison et faire preuve d’une indulgence affec- tueuse, décident d’oublier le
      passé. Chacun pourrait prier en pensant surtout au bonheur de l’autre. N’ou-
      bliez jamais que vous traitez avec le plus terrible des sentiments humains,
      la jalousie. En général, il vaut mieux attaquer stratégiquement le problème
      et éviter l’affrontement.\r\nMême si nous ne connaissons pas ces complications
      chez nous, il y a beaucoup à faire dans nos relations familiales. Parfois, un
      alcoolique vous dira que la seule chose qu’il a à faire est de ne pas boire
      ; de toute façon, s’il buvait, il n’aurait pas de foyer. Mais il doit faire
      beaucoup plus encore pour réparer ses torts envers sa femme ou ses parents qu’il
      a tant malmenés pen- dant des années. La patience de certaines mères et de certaines
      femmes d’alcooliques dépasse tout entende- ment. Sans elles, un grand nombre
      d’entre nous seraient aujourd’hui sans famille et peut-être morts.\r\nL’alcoolique
      est comme un ouragan qui ravage la vie des autres sur son passage. Il brise
      des cœurs, détruit de tendres relations, déracine des affections. Son égoïs-
      me et son manque d’égard constants maintiennent le foyer dans le tumulte. À
      notre avis, celui qui prétend qu’il suffit de ne pas boire n’a pas assez réfléchi
      à la question. Il est comme le fermier qui, en sortant de son abri après le
      passage du cyclone qui a démoli sa mai- son, se tourne vers sa femme pour lui
      dire : « Je ne vois aucun problème ici, m’man. N’est-ce pas mer- veilleux, le
      vent est tombé. »\r\nOui nous avons un long travail de reconstruction devant
      nous. Et nous devons en prendre l’initiative. Marmonner des excuses contrites
      ne suffit pas. Nous devons nous asseoir avec notre famille et analyser le passé
      franchement, tel que nous le voyons maintenant, en prenant bien soin de ne critiquer
      personne. Les défauts des autres peuvent être flagrants, mais il y a de bonnes
      chances que nos façons d’agir soient par- tiellement la cause des difficultés.
      Nous mettons donc de l’ordre dans nos relations familiales. Chaque matin au
      cours de notre méditation, nous demandons à notre Créateur de nous enseigner
      la patience, la tolérance, la bienveillance et l’amour. \r\nLa vie spirituelle
      n’est pas une théorie. Nous devons la vivre. À moins que notre famille n’exprime
      le désir de vivre selon des principes spirituels, nous croyons qu’il ne faut
      pas pousser les nôtres sur ce point. Nous devons éviter de leur parler constamment
      de spiritua- lité. Ils y viendront à leur heure. Nous prêcherons mieux par notre
      façon d’agir que par nos paroles. Nous devons nous rappeler que dix ou même
      vingt années d’alcoolisme actif peuvent rendre sceptique à peu près n’importe
      qui.\r\nCertains torts peuvent être impossibles à redresser complètement. Dans
      ce cas, si nous sommes vraiment sincères dans nos intentions, nous ne devons
      pas en faire un problème. Lorsque, par exemple, nous ne pou- vons entrer en
      contact direct avec les personnes en cause, nous leur écrivons une lettre. Il
      peut arriver aussi que nous ayons une raison valable de remettre nos excuses
      à plus tard ; mais si cela est possible, nous ne prenons pas de retard. Sans
      tomber dans la servilité ni nous montrer grincheux, nous tâchons d’agir avec
      empathie, tact, bienveillance et humilité. À titre d’agents de Dieu, nous nous
      tenons debout ; et nous ne rampons devant personne.\r\nSi nous sommes sérieux
      et appliqués dans les efforts que demande cette phase de notre évolution, nous
      serons étonnés des résultats, même après n’avoir parcouru que la moitié du chemin.
      Nous connaîtrons une nouvelle liberté et un nouveau bonheur. Nous ne regretterons
      pas plus le passé que nous ne voudrons l’oublier. Nous com- prendrons le sens
      du mot sérénité et nous connaîtrons la paix. Si profonde qu’ait été notre déchéance,
      nous ver- rons comment notre expérience peut profiter aux autres. Nous perdrons
      le sentiment d’être inutiles et cesserons de nous apitoyer sur notre sort. Mettant
      nos propres intérêts de côté, nous nous intéresserons davantage à nos semblables.
      Nous ne serons plus tournés exclusivement vers nous-mêmes. Désormais nous envisagerons
      la vie d’une façon différente. La crainte des gens et de l’insé- curité financière
      disparaîtra. Notre intuition nous dictera notre conduite dans des situations
      qui, auparavant, nous déroutaient. Soudain, nous constaterons que Dieu fait
      pour nous ce que nous ne pouvions pas faire pour nous- mêmes.\r\nEst-ce que
      ce sont là des promesses extravagantes ? Nous ne le croyons pas. Ces promesses
      se réalisent parmi nous parfois rapidement, parfois lentement. Mais elles se
      matérialisent toujours si nous travaillons dans ce sens.\r\nCette réflexion
      nous amène à la Dixième Étape qui demande de poursuivre notre inventaire personnel
      et de continuer de redresser toute nouvelle erreur com- mise en cours de route.
      En mettant de l’ordre dans notre passé, nous étions vigoureusement entrés dans
      ce genre de vie. Nous sommes entrés dans le monde de l’Esprit. Notre prochaine
      tâche est de grandir en com- préhension et en efficacité. Cela ne se fait pas
      en un jour, mais doit durer toute la vie. Nous devons tou- jours être vigilants
      pour éviter l’égoïsme, la malhon- nêteté, le ressentiment et la peur. Lorsque
      ces tendances veulent se manifester, nous demandons à Dieu de nous en délivrer
      tout de suite. Nous en discutons immédia- tement avec quelqu’un et présentons
      nos excuses le plus vite possible si nous avons causé du tort à qui- conque.
      Puis, résolument, nous pensons à une person- ne que nous pourrions aller aider.
      L’amour et la tolérance envers les autres, voilà notre code.\r\nEt nous avons
      cessé de combattre qui que ce soit ou quoi que ce soit, même l’alcool. Cette
      fois, la raison nous est revenue. Nous sommes rarement intéressés par l’alcool.
      Si nous sommes tentés, nous le fuyons comme la peste. Nous réagissons sainement
      et normalement, et nous constatons que cela arrive automatiquement. Notre nouvelle
      attitude devant l’alcool nous est venue sans effort ou réflexion de notre part.
      Cela se fait tout seul ! C’est là le miracle. Nous ne combattons pas, mais nous
      n’évitons pas non plus la tentation. C’est comme si nous avions été mis dans
      une position de neutralité, en sécurité et à l’abri. Nous n’avons même pas eu
      à jurer de ne plus recommencer. Au contraire, le problème nous a été enlevé.
      Il n’existe pas pour nous. Nous ne nous sentons ni effrayés ni suffisants. Voilà
      ce que nous vivons, et il en est ainsi tant que nous restons spirituellement
      en forme.\r\nIl est facile de commencer à négliger le programme spirituel et
      de se reposer sur ses lauriers. Si nous le faisons, nous nous préparons de sérieux
      ennuis, car l’al- cool est un ennemi subtil. Nous ne sommes pas gué- ris de
      l’alcoolisme ; nous bénéficions seulement d’un sursis quotidien, lequel dépend
      du maintien de notre forme spirituelle. Chaque jour, le souci de la volonté
      de Dieu doit être présent dans notre esprit et se mani- fester dans toute notre
      conduite. « Que dois-je faire pour Vous servir le mieux possible, pour que Votre
      volonté soit faite et non la mienne ? » Cette pensée doit nous accompagner constamment.
      Nous pouvons exercer notre propre volonté de cette façon autant que nous le
      voulons. C’est cela la bonne façon de se ser- vir de la volonté.\r\nNous avons
      déjà beaucoup dit de la force, de l’ins- piration et des directives qui nous
      viennent de Celui qui est toute connaissance et toute puissance. Si nous avons
      très sérieusement suivi Ses conseils, nous avons commencé à nous sentir pénétrés
      de Son Esprit. Nous sommes en quelque sorte devenus conscients de la pré- sence
      de Dieu. Nous avons commencé à développer ce sixième sens, d’une importance
      vitale. Mais nous devons aller plus loin encore, et cela signifie plus d’ac-
      tion.\r\nLa Onzième Étape suggère la prière et la méditation. La question de
      la prière ne devrait pas nous rendre timides. Des hommes meilleurs que nous
      s’en servent constamment. Si nous adoptons la bonne attitude ou que nous essayons
      de l’adopter, la prière donne des résultats. Il serait facile de traiter cette
      question d’une manière vague. Mais nous croyons pouvoir vous faire des suggestions
      claires et utiles.\r\nAvant de nous mettre au lit le soir, nous passons notre
      journée en revue de façon constructive. Avons- nous été égoïstes ou malhonnêtes
      ? Avons-nous éprou- vé du ressentiment, de la peur ? Devons-nous des excuses
      à quelqu’un ? Avons-nous gardé pour nous- mêmes quelque chose dont nous aurions
      dû discuter tout de suite avec une autre personne ? Avons-nous été bons et bienveillants
      avec chacun ? Y a-t-il quelque chose que nous aurions pu mieux faire ? Avons-nous
      pensé à nous-mêmes la plupart du temps ? Avons-nous cherché à être utiles aux
      autres, à apporter quelque chose dans la vie ? Toutefois nous devons prendre
      garde de ne pas tomber dans l’inquiétude, le remords ou la réflexion morbide,
      car cela nuirait à notre action auprès des autres. Une fois notre examen de
      conscien- ce terminé, nous demandons à Dieu de nous pardon- ner nos erreurs
      et de nous indiquer quelles mesures correctives nous devons prendre.\r\nÀ notre
      réveil, nous pensons au vingt-quatre heure devant nous et nous regardons nos
      projets pour la journée. Nous demandons d’abord à Dieu de nous guider dans nos
      pensées et surtout de libérer notre esprit de l’apitoiement comme de tout mobile
      malhonnête ou égoïste. Ainsi disposés, nous pouvons sans inquiétude nous servir
      de nos facultés mentales car après tout, Dieu nous a donné un cerveau pour nous
      en servir. Nos pensées seront plus élevées si notre esprit est débarrassé de
      tout motif nuisible.\r\nIl se peut que nous soyons indécis au moment de planifier
      notre journée, que nous éprouvions de la dif- ficulté à définir notre plan d’action.
      Dans ce cas, nous demandons à Dieu de nous donner l’inspiration, l’in- tuition
      qui nous fera prendre la bonne décision. Nous restons calmes et détendus. Nous
      ne nous débattons pas. Après avoir appliqué cette méthode un certain temps,
      nous sommes souvent étonnés de voir comme les bonnes réponses nous viennent.
      Ce qui auparavant n’était qu’un pressentiment ou une inspiration occa- sionnelle
      devient graduellement un mécanisme de notre esprit. Comme nous manquons d’expérience
      et que nous venons d’établir un premier contact conscient avec Dieu, nous ne
      serons probablement pas inspirés chaque fois. Il nous arrivera peut-être d’avoir
      des idées ridi- cules et de poser des gestes absurdes. Néanmoins, avec le temps,
      notre façon de réfléchir se rapprochera de plus en plus de l’inspiration. Nous
      finirons par nous y fier.\r\nEn général, nous terminons notre période de médi-
      tation par une prière par laquelle nous demandons à Dieu de nous indiquer, tout
      au long de la journée, ce que nous devrons faire dans chaque circonstance nou-
      velle et de nous fournir ce dont nous avons besoin pour régler les problèmes
      qui s’y rattachent. Nous souhai- tons surtout être libérés de notre volonté
      personnelle et nous veillons à ne rien réclamer seulement pour nous-mêmes. Nous
      pouvons toutefois faire des demandes pour nous si les autres peuvent en bénéfi-
      cier. Nous nous abstenons toujours de prier pour l’ac- complissement de nos
      désirs égoïstes. Nombreux sont ceux qui ont perdu beaucoup de temps en priant
      exclu- sivement pour eux-mêmes, et ils n’ont obtenu aucun résultat. Vous comprenez
      facilement pourquoi.\r\nSi les circonstances le permettent, nous demandons à
      notre femme ou à nos amis de se joindre à nous dans la méditation du matin.
      Si notre religion nous prescrit des dévotions matinales, nous les incluons dans
      notre séance. Si nous n’appartenons à aucune religion, par- fois nous choisissons,
      pour les mémoriser, quelques prières toutes faites qui mettent en lumière les
      prin- cipes dont nous avons discutés. Il existe également plu- sieurs livres
      utiles dans ce domaine. Un prêtre, un pasteur ou un rabbin peuvent nous en recommander.
      Empressez-vous de trouver les bons côtés de la reli- gion et mettez à profit
      ce que ces adeptes proposent.\r\nAu cours de la journée, nous faisons une pause
      lorsque l’agitation et le doute s’emparent de nous pour demander d’avoir la
      bonne pensée ou la bonne action. Sans cesse nous nous rappelons que ce n’est
      plus nous qui dirigeons le spectacle et plusieurs fois par jour, nous répétons
      humblement : « Que Votre volonté soit faite. » Nous sommes alors beaucoup moins
      exposés à prendre des décisions folles ou à être la proie de la peur, de la
      colère, de l’inquiétude ou de l’apitoiement. Nous devenons beaucoup plus efficaces.
      Nous nous fatiguons moins vite car nous ne brûlons pas notre éner- gie follement
      comme du temps où nous tentions d’ar- ranger la vie à notre convenance.\r\nÇa
      marche ! Ça marche vraiment !\r\nNous, les alcooliques, sommes indisciplinés.
      Alors, nous laissons Dieu nous montrer la voie par la simple méthode que nous
      venons d’exposer.\r\nMais ce n’est pas tout. Il nous faut agir, toujours agir
      davantage, car « la foi sans les œuvres est une foi morte ». Le chapitre suivant
      est entièrement consacré à la Douzième Étape.\r\n"

    - "L ’expérience démontre que rien n’ immunise mieux contre l’alcool que de travailler
      intensive- ment auprès d’autres alcooliques. Cette méthode fonc- tionne là où
      d’autres sont inefficaces. C’est notre douzième suggestion : transmettez ce
      message à d’autres alcooliques ! Vous pouvez être utile là où per- sonne d’autre
      ne peut réussir. Vous pouvez gagner leur confiance quand d’autres n’y parviennent
      pas. N’ou- bliez pas qu’il s’agit de grands malades. Vous trouverez un sens
      nouveau à la vie. Voir des\r\ngens se rétablir et apporter de l’aide aux autres,
      ne plus connaître la solitude, voir grandir un groupe autour de vous, avoir
      une foule d’amis, voilà une expérience à ne pas manquer. Nous croyons que vous
      ne voudrez pas laisser passer cette chance. Le contact fréquent avec les nouveaux
      et les autres, c’est ce qui illumine notre vie.\r\nPeut-être ne connaissez-vous
      pas de buveur désireux de se rétablir ? Vous pourrez sûrement en contacter un
      par l’entremise d’un médecin, d’un pasteur ou d’un prêtre, ou en vous adressant
      aux hôpitaux. Ils ne seront que trop heureux de vous épauler. Ne vous présentez
      pas à la manière d’un évangéliste ou d’un réformateur. Il existe malheureusement
      de nombreux préjugés et vous nuiriez à votre cause en les éveillant. Les ministres
      du culte et les médecins sont compétents, et vous pou- vez apprendre beaucoup
      d’eux si vous le désirez, mais grâce à votre expérience de buveur, vous êtes
      dans une position privilégiée pour aider d’autres alcooliques à s’en sortir.
      Alors misez sur la coopération, jamais sur la critique. Notre seul but est de
      nous rendre utiles.\r\nLorsque vous découvrez un candidat pour les Alcoo- liques
      anonymes, tâchez d’en savoir le plus possible à son sujet. S’il n’a pas l’intention
      de cesser de boire, ne perdez pas votre temps à essayer de le convaincre. Vous
      pourriez ruiner une chance éventuelle d’y par- venir. Ce conseil vaut également
      pour les familles de ces alcooliques. La famille doit faire preuve de patien-
      ce en ne perdant pas de vue qu’elle a affaire à un être malade.\r\nS’il manifeste
      une quelconque intention de cesser de boire, ayez un entretien sérieux avec
      la personne qui s’intéresse le plus à lui, généralement sa femme. Tâchez d’avoir
      une idée de son comportement, de ses pro- blèmes, de son passé, de la gravité
      de sa condition et de ses penchants religieux. Ces renseignements vous seront
      nécessaires si vous voulez vous mettre à sa place et voir comment vous aimeriez
      qu’il vous aborde si les rôles étaient inversés.\r\nIl est parfois préférable
      d’attendre qu’il prenne une autre cuite. La famille peut s’y opposer mais à
      moins qu’il ne soit dans une condition physique dangereuse, il vaut mieux prendre
      ce risque. Ne vous occupez pas de lui s’il est très ivre, sauf s’il devient
      agressif et que sa famille a besoin de vous. Attendez la fin de la cuite ou
      du moins jusqu’à ce qu’il ait un moment de lucidité. Laissez alors un membre
      de sa famille ou un ami lui demander s’il désire renoncer à boire pour de bon
      et s’il est prêt à tout pour y arriver. S’il répond oui, on devrait alors lui
      parler de vous, à titre d’ alcoolique qui s’ est rétabli. V ous devriez lui
      être décrit comme l’un des membres d’une association, qui, pour son propre rétablissement,
      se porte au secours des autres, et qui serait très content de lui parler s’il
      le voulait.\r\nS’il ne veut pas vous rencontrer, ne vous imposez pas. De la
      même manière, la famille doit s’abstenir de crier et de le supplier de faire
      quelque chose et doit éviter de trop le renseigner sur vous. La famille devra
      attendre la fin de sa prochaine cuite. Vous pourriez placer ce livre de sorte
      qu’il puisse le voir d’ici à ce que vous le rencontriez. Sur ce point, nous
      ne donnons aucune règle précise ; c’est à la famille de décider. Néanmoins,
      vous devez insister pour qu’elle ne se montre pas trop pressée, ce qui pour-
      rait gâter les choses.\r\nD’ordinaire, la famille ne devrait pas tenter de racon-
      ter votre histoire. Évitez si possible de rencontrer un individu par le biais
      de sa famille. Vous avez plus de chance de réussir en l’abordant par l’intermédiaire
      d’un médecin ou d’un établissement spécialisé. Si votre can- didat a besoin
      d’être hospitalisé, il devrait l’être, mais pas contre son gré, sauf s’il est
      violent. Si le médecin est d’accord, laissez ce dernier annoncer au patient
      qu’il croit avoir trouvé la solution à son problème.\r\nLorsque le malade ira
      mieux, le médecin pourra lui proposer que vous lui rendiez visite. Même si vous
      vous êtes déjà entretenu avec la famille, il vaut mieux qu’il ne soit pas question
      d’elle au cours de ce premier entretien. Ainsi, votre candidat se sentira-t-il
      libre de toute pression extérieure. Il pourra discuter avec vous sans être harcelé
      par sa famille. Tâchez d’établir le contact avec lui alors qu’il est encore
      ébranlé. Dépri- mé, il sera plus réceptif.\r\nSi possible, faites en sorte d’être
      seul avec lui. Au début, vous pouvez parler de sujets généraux. Après un moment,
      amenez la conversation sur un aspect par- ticulier de l’alcoolisme. Parlez-lui
      suffisamment de vos habitudes de buveur, des symptômes que vous aviez, de vos
      expériences, pour l’encourager à parler de lui. S’il veut se confier, laissez-le
      faire. Vous aurez ainsi une meilleure idée sur la méthode à adopter dans son
      cas. S’il se montre peu communicatif, donnez-lui un aperçu de ce qu’était votre
      vie d’alcoolique jusqu’au moment où vous avez cessé de boire. Mais pour l’ins-
      tant, ne dites rien sur la façon dont cela s’est produit. S’il est d’humeur
      sérieuse, insistez sur les ennuis que l’alcool vous a causés en prenant bien
      garde de ne pas le sermonner ni de discourir. S’il est d’humeur légère, racontez-lui
      des histoires drôles rattachées à vos esca- pades. Tâchez de l’amener lui aussi
      à raconter certaines de ses aventures.\r\nUne fois qu’il se sera rendu compte
      que l’alcool n’a pas de secret pour vous, commencez à vous décrire comme alcoolique.
      Dites-lui combien vous avez été déconcerté et comment vous avez finalement appris
      que vous étiez malade. Décrivez-lui les luttes que vous avez menées pour arrêter
      de boire. Montrez-lui quelles contor- sions mentales nous conduisent à ce premier
      verre qui débouche sur une cuite. Nous vous suggérons de procé- der comme nous
      l’indiquons dans le chapitre sur l’alcoo- lisme. S’il est alcoolique, il comprendra
      immédiatement. Il reconnaîtra ses illogismes dans les vôtres.\r\nSi vous avez
      la certitude que c’est un véritable alcoo- lique, insistez sur la nature incurable
      de cette maladie. Démontrez-lui comment, en puisant dans votre propre expérience,
      l’étrange condition mentale qui précède le premier verre empêche la volonté
      de fonctionner nor- malement. À ce stade, évitez de faire allusion à ce livre,
      à moins qu’il ne l’ait déjà vu et qu’il désire en parler.\r\nPrenez garde de
      ne pas le qualifier d’alcoolique. Lais- sez-le tirer ses propres conclusions.
      S’il s’accroche à l’idée qu’il peut encore maîtriser sa consommation d’al- cool,
      dites-lui que c’est possible s’il n’est pas trop alcoolique. Mais essayez de
      lui faire comprendre que s’il est gravement atteint, il a peu de chance de s’en
      sortir seul.\r\nContinuez de parler de l’alcoolisme comme d’une maladie, une
      maladie fatale. Parlez des conditions phy- siques et mentales qui l’accompagnent.
      Dirigez conti- nuellement son attention sur votre expérience personnelle. Expliquez-lui
      que plusieurs seront condamnés sans jamais s’être rendu compte de la gra- vité
      de leur misérable état. On comprend que les méde- cins répugnent à exposer aux
      patients alcooliques le fond du problème, à moins qu’ils n’aient de bonnes raisons
      pour le faire. Mais vous, vous pouvez parler de l’aspect irrémédiable de l’alcoolisme
      parce que vous proposez une solution. En peu de temps, votre ami aura reconnu
      qu’il présente plusieurs, sinon toutes les carac- téristiques de l’alcoolique.
      Si son médecin est d’accord pour lui apprendre qu’il est alcoolique, tant mieux.
      Même si votre protégé n’a pas reconnu sa condition, il peut toutefois se montrer
      curieux de savoir comment vous vous êtes rétabli. Laissez-le vous poser la ques-
      tion s’il le désire. Dites-lui exactement ce qui vous est arrivé. Insistez en
      toute liberté sur l’aspect spirituel. Si votre candidat est athée ou agnostique,
      expliquez-lui clairement qu’il n’est pas obligé d’être d’accord avec votre conception
      de Dieu. Il peut concevoir Dieu comme il lui plaît, à la condition que cette
      conception ait une signification pour lui. L’important est qu’il veuille croire
      en une Puissance supérieure à lui-même et qu’il vive selon des principes spirituels.
      \r\nLorsque vous traitez avec une telle personne, vous avez intérêt à utiliser
      le langage de tous les jours pour décrire les principes spirituels. Il est inutile
      de soule- ver les préjugés qu’il pourrait avoir contre certaines conceptions
      ou terminologies théologiques qui sèment peut-être déjà la confusion dans son
      esprit. Évitez d’aborder ces sujets, quelles que soient vos propres convictions.\r\nIl
      se peut que votre candidat appartienne à une reli- gion et que son éducation
      et sa formation religieuses soient supérieures aux vôtres. Si c’est le cas,
      il ne verra pas ce que vous pourriez ajouter à ses connaissances. Cependant,
      il sera intrigué de savoir pourquoi ses propres convictions ne l’ont pas aidé
      alors que les vôtres semblent si efficaces. Il peut être un exemple que la foi
      seule est insuffisante. Pour que la foi soit vivante, elle doit s’accompagner
      du don de soi, d’une action constructive et désintéressée. Faites-lui com- prendre
      que vous n’êtes pas là pour l’instruire sur la religion. Tout en admettant qu’il
      en sait sans doute plus long que vous sur ce sujet, attirez son attention sur
      le fait suivant : si profondes que soient sa foi et ses connaissances, il ne
      les a sûrement pas mises en pra- tique, sinon il ne boirait pas. Le récit de
      votre expé- rience pourrait l’aider à découvrir où il n’a pas mis en œuvre les
      préceptes qu’il connaît si bien. Nous ne repré- sentons aucune croyance ni confession
      religieuse par- ticulière. Nous ne faisons qu’exposer des principes généraux
      communs à la plupart des religions.\r\nExposez-lui le programme d’action en
      lui expli- quant comment vous avez effectué votre auto-critique, comment vous
      avez redressé les torts de votre passé et pourquoi, maintenant, vous cherchez
      à lui venir en aide. C’est important pour lui de bien comprendre que vos efforts
      pour lui communiquer le message sont un élément vital de votre propre rétablissement
      et que, en fait, il peut vous aider plus que vous ne l’aidez. Expliquez-lui
      clairement qu’il n’a aucune obli- gation envers vous et que vous espérez seulement
      qu’il tentera de venir en aide à d’autres alcooliques quand il se sera sorti
      de ses difficultés. Tâchez de lui faire voir à quel point il se doit de placer
      le bien- être des autres avant le sien. Donnez-lui l’assurance que vous n’exercez
      aucune pression sur lui et que vous ne le reverrez plus si tel est son désir.
      Ajoutez que vous ne serez pas offusqué s’il ne veut plus entendre parler de
      vous, car il vous a aidé plus que vous ne l’avez aidé vous-même. Si vous avez
      parlé avec calme et bon sens et que vous vous êtes mon- tré humain et compréhensif,
      vous vous êtes proba- blement fait un ami. Il se peut que la question de l’alcoolisme
      l’ait dérangé. Tant mieux ! Plus il se sentira désespéré, mieux cela vaudra.
      Il y a ainsi davantage de chance qu’il suive vos suggestions.\r\nVotre candidat
      peut trouver des raisons pour les- quelles il pense n’avoir pas besoin de suivre
      le pro- gramme au complet. Il peut se rebeller à l’idée de faire un examen de
      conscience qui requiert une discussion avec d’autres personnes. Il vaut mieux
      ne pas le contre- dire. Dites-lui au contraire que vous avez ressenti la même
      chose, mais que vous doutez aujourd’hui que vous auriez fait autant de progrès
      si vous n’aviez pas consenti à passer à l’action. Lors de votre première visite,
      entretenez-le du mouvement des Alcooliques anonymes. S’il montre quelque intérêt,
      laissez-lui votre exemplaire de ce livre.\r\nÀ moins que votre ami ne veuille
      parler davantage de lui, ne mettez pas sa patience à l’épreuve. Donnez-lui la
      chance de réfléchir. Si vous restez, laissez-le orienter la conversation. Il
      peut arriver qu’un nouveau, empressé, veuille s’engager tout de suite et que
      vous soyez tenté de le laisser faire. C’est parfois une erreur. S’il éprouvait
      des difficultés par la suite, il pourrait vous reprocher de l’ avoir bousculé.
      V ous réussirez mieux auprès des alcooliques en évitant de vous présenter comme
      un croisé ou un réformateur passionné. Ne parlez jamais à un alcoolique du haut
      de votre grandeur morale ou spiri- tuelle ; contentez-vous de lui présenter
      les outils spiri- tuels pour qu’il les examine. Démontrez-lui comment ils vous
      ont servi. Offrez-lui l’amitié et la fraternité. Dites- lui que s’il désire
      se rétablir, vous ferez n’importe quoi pour l’aider.\r\nSi votre solution ne
      l’intéresse pas, s’il attend de vous seulement que vous le sortiez de ses difficultés
      financières comme un banquier, ou si tout ce qu’il cherche est une infirmière
      pour l’aider dans ses moments de cuite, il vaut mieux renoncer à l’aider jus-
      qu’à ce qu’il ait changé d’idée. Ce changement d’atti- tude se produira lorsqu’il
      aura souffert davantage.\r\nSi votre candidat démontre un intérêt sincère et
      qu’il veut vous revoir, demandez-lui de lire ce livre avant votre prochaine
      visite. Ensuite, il décidera de lui-même s’il veut poursuivre sa démarche. Il
      ne doit jamais être pressé ni bousculé ni par vous ni par sa femme ou ses amis.
      S’il doit trouver Dieu, le désir doit lui venir du fond de lui-même.\r\nS’il
      croit qu’il y a une autre façon de s’en sortir ou s’il préfère une approche
      spirituelle différente, encou- ragez-le à écouter sa conscience. Nous ne détenons
      pas l’exclusivité des liens avec Dieu ; nous avons seule- ment une méthode qui
      nous a réussi. Cependant, insis- tez sur le fait que les alcooliques ont beaucoup
      en commun et que de toute façon, vous aimeriez garder un lien amical avec lui.
      Puis, laissez les choses comme elles sont.\r\nNe vous découragez pas si votre
      candidat ne répond pas immédiatement. Partez à la recherche d’un autre alcoolique
      et essayez encore. Vous trouverez certaine- ment un malade assez désespéré pour
      accepter sans hésiter ce que vous avez à offrir. Insister auprès de quelqu’un
      qui ne peut ou ne veut pas travailler avec vous, c’est, à notre avis, une perte
      de temps. Laissé à lui-même, il pourrait, en peu de temps, découvrir qu’il ne
      peut se rétablir par ses propres moyens. Passer trop de temps sur un cas prive
      un autre alcoolique de l’oc- casion de vivre normalement et d’être heureux.
      Un de nos membres a échoué complètement dans ses six pre- mières tentatives.
      Il aime répéter que s’il avait pour- suivi son action auprès de ces alcooliques,
      il en aurait peut-être privé beaucoup d’autres, sauvés depuis, de leur chance
      de se rétablir.\r\nSupposons maintenant que vous rendez une deuxiè- me visite
      à votre candidat. Il a lu ce livre et se dit prêt à faire les Douze Étapes du
      programme de rétablisse- ment. Ayant vous-même vécu cette expérience, vous êtes
      en mesure de lui donner des conseils pratiques. Laissez-lui savoir que vous
      êtes disposé à recevoir ses confidences lorsqu’il aura décidé de raconter son
      his- toire, mais n’insistez pas s’il préfère consulter une autre personne.\r\nIl
      peut être sans argent et sans abri. Si c’est le cas, vous pourriez l’aider à
      se trouver du travail ou lui offrir une petite aide financière. Néanmoins, vous
      ne devez pas priver votre famille ou vos créanciers de l’argent qui leur revient.
      Vous aimeriez peut-être le loger chez vous durant quelques jours. Mais agissez
      toujours avec discernement. Assurez-vous qu’il sera accepté par votre famille
      et qu’il n’est pas là pour profiter indûment de votre argent, de vos contacts
      ou de votre hospitalité. Ses abus ne pourraient que lui causer du tort. Vous
      lui donne- riez l’occasion d’être malhonnête et ainsi, vous contri- bueriez
      à sa destruction plutôt qu’à son rétablissement.\r\nNe fuyez jamais devant vos
      responsabilités mais assurez-vous que vous agissez sagement en les assu- mant.
      L’aide aux autres est la pierre angulaire de votre rétablissement. Une bonne
      action de temps en temps n’est pas suffisante. Vous devez agir en bon Samari-
      tain tous les jours s’il le faut. Cela peut signifier que vous passerez plusieurs
      nuits blanches et que vos loi- sirs et vos affaires seront souvent interrompus.
      Peut- être devrez-vous partager votre argent et votre foyer, conseiller les
      conjoints et les parents pris de panique, vous présenter de nombreuses fois
      au poste de police, dans les cliniques, les hôpitaux, les prisons et les centres
      de soins psychiatriques. Votre téléphone pour- ra sonner à toute heure du jour
      et de la nuit. Votre femme se plaindra peut-être que vous la négligez. Un alcoolique
      soûl peut briser votre mobilier ou brûler un matelas. Vous pourriez devoir vous
      battre avec lui s’il est violent. Parfois vous devrez appeler un médecin et
      suivre ses directives pour administrer un sédatif à votre protégé. À d’autres
      moments, vous pourriez être dans l’obligation d’avoir recours à la police ou
      d’appeler une ambulance. Occasionnellement, vous ferez face à des situations
      comme celles-là.\r\nIl est rare que nous permettions à un alcoolique de vivre
      longtemps chez nous parce que ce n’est pas bon pour lui et que cela entraîne
      parfois de graves com- plications dans la famille.\r\nLe refus d’un alcoolique
      de collaborer à son rétablissement n’est pas une raison pour négliger ses proches.
      Vous devriez maintenir des liens amicaux avec eux et leur offrir d’adopter votre
      mode de vie. S’ils acceptaient de mettre en pratique vos principes spiri- tuels,
      le chef de famille aurait de bien meilleures chances de se rétablir. Et même
      s’il devait continuer de boire, sa famille trouverait la vie plus supportable.\r\nQuant
      à l’alcoolique qui peut et veut se rétablir, il n’a guère besoin de charité,
      au sens ordinaire du mot, ou du moins il n’en demandera pas beaucoup. Les alcooliques
      qui réclament de l’argent et un abri avant de surmonter leur problème d’alcool
      font fausse route. Cependant, nous sommes prêts à de grands sacrifices lorsque
      cette action est justifiée pour nous aider les uns les autres. Cela peut sembler
      contradictoire mais pour nous, ce ne l’est pas.\r\nNous ne remettons pas en
      cause le don lui-même, mais plutôt le moment et la manière de donner. C’est
      souvent là qu’est la différence entre la réussite et l’échec. À partir du moment
      où notre action est essen- tiellement d’ordre matériel, l’alcoolique commence
      à compter sur notre assistance plutôt que sur celle de Dieu. Il réclame ceci
      et cela, prétextant son incapaci- té à maîtriser l’alcool si ses besoins matériels
      ne sont pas satisfaits. C’est un non-sens. Certains d’entre nous ont dû encaisser
      de rudes coups avant de comprendre ceci : avec ou sans emploi, avec ou sans
      conjoint, nous ne cessons tout simplement pas de boire tant que nous faisons
      passer notre dépendance des autres avant notre dépendance envers Dieu.\r\nIl
      faut graver dans l’esprit de chaque alcoolique qu’il peut se rétablir indépendamment
      de qui que ce soit. La seule condition est de mettre sa confiance en Dieu et
      de mettre de l’ordre dans sa vie.\r\nVoyons maintenant les problèmes au foyer.
      Il se peut qu’il y ait divorce, séparation ou simplement des rela- tions tendues.
      Lorsque votre candidat aura redressé, autant qu’il le peut, les torts causés
      aux siens et qu’il leur aura bien expliqué les nouveaux principes selon lesquels
      il vit, il devra commencer à mettre ceux-ci en pratique à la maison. Nous parlons
      évidemment de ceux qui ont la chance d’avoir un foyer. Il ne doit pas tenir
      compte du fait que sa famille puisse avoir de nom- breux torts. Il doit se concentrer
      sur sa propre spiri- tualité. Les discussions et les réprimandes doivent être
      évitées à tout prix. Cela est difficile à faire dans nombre de foyers, mais
      c’est indispensable si l’on veut obte- nir des résultats. Si la famille persiste
      dans ses efforts pendant quelques mois, elle en retirera un grand bien- fait.
      Les personnalités moins compatibles finissent par découvrir des terrains d’entente.
      Avec le temps, chaque membre de la famille peut en venir à voir ses propres
      défauts et à les admettre. Tous sont alors davantage en mesure d’en discuter
      dans une atmosphère d’entraide amicale.\r\nLorsque la famille aura constaté
      les résultats tan- gibles de la méthode, elle se montrera peut-être dis- posée
      à faire de même. Cela se fera naturellement et en temps voulu, pourvu que l’alcoolique
      continue, quoi que l’on fasse et quoi que l’on dise, de démontrer qu’il peut
      demeurer abstinent, serviable et attentif envers les autres. Bien sûr, il nous
      arrive à tous de nous nous écarter souvent de ces règles de conduite. Nous devons
      alors tenter de réparer immédiatement le tort causé, sinon nous le paierons
      par une rechute.\r\nDans une situation de divorce ou de séparation, le couple
      ne devrait pas montrer une hâte excessive à se retrouver. L’alcoolique doit
      être sûr de son rétablissement. De son côté, la femme doit parfaitement comprendre
      son nouveau mode de vie. Si la relation doit reprendre, les bases de cette nouvelle
      union devront être différentes puisque les précédentes n’ont pas tenu. Cela
      exige un changement total d’esprit et d’attitude. Parfois, il vaut mieux pour
      tous les inté- ressés que le couple demeure séparé. De toute évi- dence, aucune
      règle ne peut être établie à ce sujet. Il faut laisser l’alcoolique poursuivre
      son programme jour après jour et quand le temps des retrouvailles sera venu,
      ce sera clair pour les deux personnes en cause.\r\nIl faut détromper l’alcoolique
      qui dit ne pouvoir se rétablir sans avoir retrouvé sa famille. C’est faux. Dans
      certains cas, pour une raison ou pour une autre, le conjoint ne revient jamais.
      Il faut rappeler à ce candi- dat que son rétablissement ne dépend pas des autres.
      Il dépend de sa relation avec Dieu. Nous connaissons des hommes qui se sont
      rétablis sans n’avoir jamais retrouvé leur famille. Par ailleurs, d’autres ont
      rechu- té à cause de leur retour prématuré.\r\nIl faut que, jour après jour,
      votre protégé et vous mar- chiez ensemble sur le chemin du progrès spirituel.
      Si vous persistez, des choses remarquables se produiront. En jetant un regard
      sur le passé, nous constatons que ce qui nous est arrivé au moment où nous avons
      remis notre sort entre les mains de Dieu était mieux que tout ce que nous avions
      escompté. Si vous suivez les directives d’une Puissance supérieure, vous finirez
      par vivre dans un monde nouveau et merveilleux, quelles que soient les circonstancesactuelles
      !\r\nLorsque vous vous occupez d’un homme et de sa famille, vous devez prendre
      soin de ne pas vous mêler de leurs querelles pour éviter de ruiner vos chances
      de leur être utile. Insistez cependant auprès des proches sur le fait que l’alcoolique
      a été très malade et qu’ils devraient en tenir compte dans leurs rapports avec
      lui. Mettez-les en garde contre le ressentiment et la jalousie, et préve- nez-les
      qu’il ne pourra pas se corriger de ses défauts en un jour. Faites comprendre
      à la famille que votre protégé est entré dans une période de croissance et demandez
      à ses proches, lorsqu’ils se sentent impatients, de penser plutôt au bonheur
      de le voir abstinent.\r\nSi vous avez réussi à régler vos propres problèmes
      familiaux, racontez à la famille du nouveau comment vous vous y êtes pris. C’est
      une façon de la mettre sur une bonne piste sans devenir critique à son sujet.
      Dire comment vous et votre conjoint avez surmonté vos dif- ficultés vaut mieux
      que toutes les remontrances.\r\nSi nous sommes spirituellement en forme, nous
      pou- vons accomplir toutes sortes de choses qui, normale- ment, sont contre-indiquées
      pour les alcooliques. On a dit que nous ne devrions pas aller là où l’on sert
      de l’alcool, que nous ne devons pas garder d’alcool à la maison, que nous devons
      éviter les amis qui prennent un verre, que nous devons nous abstenir de regarder
      tout film où l’on voit des gens boire, que nous devons éviter les bars, que
      nos amis doivent cacher leurs bou- teilles si nous allons chez eux, que nous
      ne devons pas penser à l’alcool et que rien ne doit nous y faire pen- ser. L’expérience
      nous a démontré que ce n’est pas nécessairement vrai.\r\nTous les jours, nous
      nous retrouvons dans l’une ou l’autre de ces situations. L’alcoolique qui ne
      peut y faire face pense encore comme un alcoolique ; quelque chose ne va pas
      dans son état spirituel. Le seul endroit où il aurait une chance de demeurer
      sobre serait, par exemple, la calotte du Groenland ; et même là, un Inuit pourrait
      se présenter avec une bouteille de scotch à la main : ce serait le désastre
      ! Toute femme qui a envoyé son mari au loin pour qu’il échappe à l’alcool peut
      en parler.\r\nÀ notre avis, toute méthode de lutte contre l’alcoo- lisme qui
      propose de garder le malade à l’abri des ten- tations est vouée à l’échec. L’alcoolique
      qui essaie de se protéger peut réussir pendant un certain temps mais cela se
      termine généralement par une rechute plus dure que toutes les autres. Nous avons
      essayé ces méthodes- là. Mais ces tentatives pour réaliser l’impossible ont
      toujours échoué.\r\nNous avons comme principe de ne pas éviter la fré- quentation
      de lieux où l’on sert de l’alcool si nous avons une bonne raison de nous trouver
      là. Ces endroits peuvent être des bars, des boîtes de nuit, des soirées dansantes,
      des réceptions de mariage ou autres, et même les joyeuses réunions mondaines
      courantes. Si vous avez déjà travaillé auprès d’un alcoolique, vous aurez peut-être
      l’impression que c’est là tenter le diable, mais il n’en est rien.\r\nVous remarquerez
      que nous avons apporté une importante restriction. Par conséquent, à chaque
      occa- sion, posez-vous la question : « Ai-je une bonne rai- son, sociale, professionnelle
      ou personnelle, d’aller à cet endroit ? » ; « Est-ce que j’espère trouver une
      espèce de substitution du plaisir d’autrefois dans l’am- biance qui règne là
      ? » Si vous êtes à l’aise avec votre réponse, vous n’avez pas à vous inquiéter.
      Allez- y ou n’y allez pas, comme bon vous semble. Assu- rez-vous toutefois que
      vous êtes spirituellement solide et que vos motifs sont vraiment valables. Ne
      pensez pas à ce que vous allez retirer de l’événement ; pen- sez plutôt à ce
      que vous pouvez y apporter. Mais si vous ne vous sentez pas sûr de vous, vous
      feriez mieux plutôt d’aller porter secours à un autre alcoo- lique !\r\nPourquoi
      fréquenter les lieux où l’on boit si c’est pour afficher une triste mine en
      regrettant le bon vieux temps ? Si l’occasion est heureuse, tâchez de contri-
      buer au plaisir des gens ; si c’est une réunion d’af- faires, mettez-vous à
      la besogne avec enthousiasme. Si vous êtes avec quelqu’un qui veut manger dans
      une brasserie, n’hésitez pas à l’accompagner. Dites à vos amis qu’ils ne doivent
      pas changer leurs habitudes à cause de vous. Lorsque l’occasion sera propice,
      expli- quez-leur pourquoi vous devez vous abstenir de boire. Si vous présentez
      bien la chose, il y a peu de chance que l’on vous incite à consommer. Au temps
      où vous buviez, vous vous retiriez de la vie, petit à petit. Aujourd’hui, vous
      retrouvez votre place dans la socié- té. Vous ne devez pas vous retirer à nouveau
      du simple fait que vos amis prennent un verre.\r\nDésormais, votre devoir est
      de vous trouver là où vous pouvez le plus rendre service ; alors n’hésitez pas
      à aller partout où vous pouvez être utile. Même l’en- droit le plus sordide
      au monde ne doit pas vous faire reculer lorsque le désir de servir vous motive.
      Dans cet état d’esprit, vous pouvez vous tenir sur la ligne de front et Dieu
      vous protégera de tout danger.\r\nBeaucoup d’entre nous gardons de l’alcool
      à la mai- son. Nous en avons souvent besoin pour aider une recrue à traverser
      les durs lendemains de cuites. Quelques-uns servent de l’alcool à leurs amis
      qui ne sont pas alcooliques. Cependant, certains d’entre nous croient que nous
      ne devrions pas en servir. Nous ne discutons jamais de cette question. C’est
      à chaque famille de décider, en fonction des circonstances, de la conduite à
      suivre.\LNous prenons garde de ne jamais démontrer d’into-\r\nlérance ou de
      mépris envers l’habitude sociale qu’est la consommation d’ alcool. L ’ expérience
      a prouvé qu’une attitude de ce genre n’apporte rien à personne. Tous les alcooliques
      nouvellement arrivés dans notre groupe s’attendent à nous voir critiquer et
      juger, puis sont grandement soulagés lorsqu’ils découvrent que nous ne faisons
      pas la chasse aux sorcières. L’esprit d’intolérance pourrait rebuter des alcooliques
      qui, sans cette étroitesse d’esprit, seraient peut-être sauvés. En étant intransigeant,
      nous n’aiderions même pas la cause de la tempérance car pas un buveur sur mille
      n’ac- cepterait d’entendre parler de son problème par quel- qu’un qui a l’alcool
      en aversion.\r\nUn jour viendra, nous l’espérons, où grâce aux Alcooliques anonymes,
      la population se rendra mieux compte de l’ampleur et de la gravité du problème
      de l’alcoolisme. Cependant, si nous adoptons une attitude amère et hostile,
      notre action restera sans grand effet. Les buveurs ne le supporteraient pas.\r\nAprès
      tout, c’est nous qui sommes responsables de nos problèmes. La bouteille n’ est
      qu’ un symbole. D’ailleurs, nous ne combattons plus qui que ce soit ou quoi
      que ce soit. Il le faut !\r\n"

    - AUX CONJOINTES
    - "Jusqu’à maintenant et sauf rares exceptions, notre livre a surtout parlé des
      hommes. Cependant, nos propos s’appliquent tout autant aux femmes. Nous\r\nintervenons
      de plus en plus auprès de femmes qui boi- vent. Tout prouve que les femmes recouvrent
      la santé aussi bien que les hommes si elles s’efforcent de suivre nos suggestions.\r\nTout
      homme qui boit ne peut le faire sans affecter d’autres gens : la femme qui tremble
      de peur en pen- sant à la prochaine cuite de son mari ou le père et la mère
      qui voient leur fils gâcher sa vie.\r\nIl se trouve parmi nous autant de conjointes,
      de parents et d’amis ayant réglé leur problème qu’il y en a qui ne lui ont pas
      encore trouvé de solution heureu- se. Nous voulons que les conjointes des Alcooliques
      anonymes s’adressent aux femmes dont les maris boi- vent trop. Leurs conseils
      peuvent être suivis par la quasi-totalité des gens liés par le sang ou par l’affec-
      tion à un alcoolique.\r\nÀ titre de conjointes d’un membre des Alcooliques anonymes,
      nous aimerions vous faire sentir que nous comprenons votre situation comme peu
      de gens peuvent le faire. Nous voulons analyser les erreurs que nous avons commises.
      Notre but est de vous laisser avec le sentiment profond qu’aucune situation
      n’est trop diffi- cile, aucun malheur trop grand pour être surmontés.\r\nIl
      n’y a aucun doute que notre route a été très dif- ficile. Nous avons eu rendez-vous
      pendant très long- temps avec un orgueil blessé, la frustration, l’apitoiement
      sur nous-mêmes, l’incompréhension et la peur. Ces compagnons ne sont pas du
      tout agréables. Parfois nous avons été habitées par la mélancolie, par- fois
      par un ressentiment amer. Certaines d’entre nous passaient d’un extrême à l’autre,
      ne cessant d’espérer qu’un jour nos bien-aimés redeviendraient eux-mêmes.\r\nNotre
      loyauté et notre désir de voir nos maris mar- cher la tête haute et se comporter
      comme les autres hommes ont engendré toutes sortes de situations diffi- ciles.
      Nous nous sommes dévouées et sacrifiées sans compter. Nous avons raconté d’innombrables
      men- songes pour protéger notre orgueil autant que la répu- tation de nos maris.
      Nous avons prié, supplié, nous avons été patientes. Nous avons frappé violemment.
      Nous nous sommes enfuies. Nous avons eu des crises d’hystérie. Nous avons été
      paralysées par la terreur. Nous avons recherché la sympathie. Pour nous venger,
      nous avons eu des aventures avec d’autres hommes.\r\nDe nombreux soirs ont vu
      notre maison se transformer en champ de bataille. Le matin, nous nous embrassions
      et refaisions la paix. Nos amis nous ont conseillé de plaquer nos conjoints
      et bien déterminées, nous les avons écoutés, pour finalement revenir avec l’espoir,
      toujours l’espoir. Nos hommes ont juré haut et fort que jamais plus ils ne boiraient.
      Nous les avons crus, envers et contre tous. Au bout de quelques jours, de quelques
      semaines ou de quelques mois, c’était la chute à nouveau.\r\nNous invitions
      rarement des amis à la maison, ne sachant jamais quand ni dans quel état nos
      hommes arriveraient. Nous acceptions peu d’invitations. Nous en étions venues
      à vivre presque seules. Lorsque nous étions invitées, nos maris buvaient tellement
      qu’ils gâchaient la rencontre. Si, au contraire, ils ne prenaient pas une goutte
      d’alcool, ils s’apitoyaient sur eux-mêmes et devenaient des rabat-joie.\r\nLa
      sécurité financière n’existait pas pour nous. Nos maris perdaient leur emploi
      ou étaient sans cesse mena- cés de le perdre. Même un véhicule blindé n’aurait
      pas suffi à apporter l’enveloppe de paye à la maison. Les comptes-chèques fondaient
      comme neige au soleil.\r\nParfois, une autre femme apparaissait dans leur vie.
      Apprendre son existence nous a brisé le cœur et nous avons cruellement souffert
      de nous faire dire que cette femme comprenait notre homme mieux que nous !\r\nNos
      maris nous accusaient d’ être inhospitalières envers les agents de recouvrement,
      les commissaires, les chauffeurs de taxi irrités, les policiers, les voyous,
      les copains, et même envers les petites dames qu’ils ramenaient parfois à la
      maison. « Rabat-joie, har- gneuse, trouble-fête », disaient-ils. Le lendemain,
      ils redevenaient eux-mêmes ; nous pardonnions et essayions d’oublier.\r\nNous
      avons fait en sorte que les enfants continuent d’aimer leur père. Aux tout-petits,
      nous racontions qu’il était malade ; cette explication était en fait plus vraie
      que nous ne le croyions. Nos conjoints ont frappé leurs enfants, démoli des
      panneaux de portes, brisé des objets précieux, arraché les touches de piano.
      Puis, au milieu de ce charivari, il arrivait qu’ils prennent la porte en menaçant
      d’ aller vivre pour toujours avec l’ autre femme. Désespérées, nous nous sommes
      même enivrées à notre tour : la cuite du siècle. Mais, résul- tat inattendu,
      voilà qui semblait plaire à nos maris.\r\nRendues à ce stade, certaines ont
      divorcé et ont amené les enfants chez papa et maman. Nous essuyions alors les
      critiques sévères des beaux-parents qui nous accusaient de déserter le domicile
      conjugal. La plupart ne sont pas parties. Nous restions, encore et encore. Finalement,
      comme la misère guettait la famille, nous avons cherché du travail.\r\nComme
      les crises se rapprochaient, nous avons com- mencé à demander conseil à des
      médecins. Les inquié- tants symptômes physiques et mentaux, le poids de plus
      en plus profond des remords, la dépression et le sen- timent d’infériorité qui
      accablaient les hommes que nous aimions, tout cela nous terrifiait et nous affolait.
      Comme des animaux cherchant à sortir de leur cage, nous nous sommes esquintées
      à grimper avec patien- ce les barreaux de notre prison pour retomber aussitôt,
      épuisées par tant d’efforts infructueux. La majorité d’entre nous avons vu nos
      conjoints franchir le stade final de l’alcoolisme, celui des centres de désintoxica-
      tion, des cliniques, des hôpitaux et des prisons. Parfois c’était le délire,
      les hurlements, la démence. Souvent, la mort rôdait.\r\nDans ces conditions,
      nous avons naturellement com- mis des erreurs. Certaines étaient dues à notre
      manque de connaissances sur l’alcoolisme. De temps en temps, nous avions la
      vague impression de nous trouver en face d’hommes malades. Nous aurions peut-être
      agi dif- féremment si nous avions tout à fait compris la natu- re de cette maladie
      qu’est l’alcoolisme.\r\nComment des hommes qui aimaient leur femme et leurs
      enfants pouvaient-ils se montrer si peu réfléchis, si insensibles et si cruels
      ? Il était impossible que ces gens-là puissent aimer, pensions-nous. Et juste
      comme nous venions de nous convaincre qu’ils n’avaient pas de cœur, ils nous
      étonnaient par des résolutions et des attentions renouvelées. Pour un temps,
      ils redevenaient les maris gentils que nous avions connus, pour ensui- te mettre
      en pièces cette nouvelle forme d’affection. Lorsqu’on leur demandait pourquoi
      ils avaient recom- mencé à boire, ils répondaient par une excuse idiote, ou
      ils ne répondaient pas du tout. Nous en étions désem- parées, cruellement blessées.
      Était-il possible que nous nous soyons trompées à ce point sur l’homme que nous
      avions épousé ? Lorsqu’ils buvaient, ils devenaient des étrangers. Ils étaient
      parfois si inaccessibles qu’ils don- naient l’impression qu’un grand mur avait
      été érigé autour d’eux.\r\nEt même s’ils n’aimaient pas leur famille, comment
      pouvaient-ils être aussi aveugles au sujet d’eux- mêmes ? Qu’était-il advenu
      de leur jugement, de leur bon sens, de leur volonté ? Comment pouvaient-ils
      ne pas voir que pour eux, l’alcool signifiait la ruine ? Pourquoi après qu’on
      leur eut exposé les dangers qu’ils couraient et après l’avoir admis, retournaient-ils
      boire immédiatement ?\r\nCe sont là des questions qui traversent l’esprit de
      toutes les femmes d’alcooliques Nous espérons que ce livre aura répondu à quelques-unes
      de ces interrogations. Peut-être votre mari a-t-il vécu depuis un certain temps
      dans ce monde étrange de l’alcoolisme, là où tout est déformé et exagéré. Lorsqu’il
      se trouve dans un état nor- mal, vous vous rendez compte qu’il vous aime vraiment.
      Bien sûr on rencontre parfois des cas d’incompatibilité mais habituellement,
      le manque d’égards et d’affection de l’alcoolique ne sont qu’une apparence ;
      ses paroles et ses gestes épouvantables sont généralement dus à sa maladie et
      à son esprit faussé. Aujourd’hui, la plupart de nos hommes sont de bons maris
      et de bons pères, meilleurs qu’ils ne l’étaient auparavant.\r\nQuoi que dise
      ou fasse votre mari alcoolique, essayez de ne pas le condamner. Il n’est qu’une
      autre person- ne malade et privée de raison. Quand vous le pouvez, traitez-le
      comme s’il avait une pneumonie. Lorsqu’il vous met en colère, rappelez-vous
      que c’est un grand malade.\r\nIl y a toutefois une grande exception à ce qui
      pré- cède. Nous nous rendons compte que certains hommes sont foncièrement malintentionnés
      et que la patience, si grande soit-elle, n’est d’aucun secours dans leur cas.
      Un alcoolique de ce tempérament-là aura vite fait de se servir de ce chapitre
      contre vous. Ne le laissez pas faire. Si vous êtes certaine que c’est le cas
      de votre mari, peut-être aurez-vous le sentiment qu’il vaut mieux le quitter.
      Devez-vous le laisser ruiner votre vie et celle de vos enfants ? Surtout, quand
      il a à sa portée les moyens de cesser de boire et d’arrêter ses abus de toutes
      sortes, si seulement il veut vraiment en payer le prix.\r\nLes problèmes avec
      lesquels vous vous débattez en général sont parmi les quatre suivants :\r\nUn
      : Votre mari pourrait n’être qu’un gros buveur. Soit qu’il boive constamment,
      soit qu’il boive beau- coup en certaines occasions. Il dépense peut-être trop
      d’argent en alcool. Ses facultés mentales et physiques diminuent peut-être sans
      qu’il ne s’en rende compte. Il est parfois une source d’embarras pour vous et
      pour ses amis. Il a la certitude de pouvoir maîtriser l’al- cool, que boire
      ne lui fait pas de tort et que c’est même nécessaire à la bonne marche de ses
      affaires. Il serait probablement insulté d’être qualifié d’alcoolique.\r\nLe
      monde est rempli de gens comme lui. Certains diminuent ou cessent leur consommation
      d’alcool tan- dis que d’autres n’en font rien. Parmi ceux qui conti- nuent,
      un bon nombre deviendront de vrais alcooliques après un certain temps.\r\nDeux
      : Votre mari ne se contrôle pas car il est inca- pable de ne pas boire même
      lorsqu’il le veut. Il perd souvent la tête quand il boit. Il reconnaît cet état
      de choses, mais il est certain que cela va s’améliorer. Il s’est mis en frais
      d’essayer, avec ou sans votre colla- boration, divers moyens pour modérer ou
      stopper sa consommation d’alcool. Il commence peut-être à perdre ses amis. Il
      se peut que ses affaires soient plus ou moins mal en point. Par moments, il
      est inquiet et com- mence à constater son incapacité de boire comme les autres.
      Il lui arrive de boire le matin et durant la jour- née afin de calmer sa nervosité.
      Après des cuites graves, il est pris de remords et vous dit qu’il veut cesser
      de boire. Mais une fois remis, il recommence à s’imagi- ner comment il s’y prendra
      pour boire modérément la prochaine fois. À notre avis, cet homme est en danger.
      Il a tous les symptômes du véritable alcoolique. Il se peut qu’il puisse encore
      s’occuper assez bien de ses affaires. Il n’est pas loin d’avoir tout gâché.
      Comme nous le disons entre nous : « Il voudrait vouloir arrê- ter. »\r\nTrois
      : Ici, le mari est rendu beaucoup plus loin que dans le cas numéro deux. Cet
      homme est passé par le stade décrit au numéro deux, mais sa condition s’est
      détériorée. Ses amis se sont éclipsés, son foyer bat de l’aile et il ne peut
      garder d’emploi. Il a peut-être été vu par un médecin et la pénible ronde des
      cliniques et des hôpitaux a commencé. Il reconnaît qu’il est inca- pable de
      boire comme les autres, mais ne voit pas pourquoi. Il s’accroche à l’idée qu’il
      va finir par trouver une façon d’y arriver. Il peut en être au point où il veut
      désespérément cesser de boire mais il en est inca- pable. Son cas soulève d’autres
      questions auxquelles nous tâcherons de répondre pour vous. Une situation comme
      celle-ci vous permet d’espérer.\r\nQuatre : Il s’agit du mari alcoolique dont
      le cas vous désespère complètement. Il est passé d’un éta- blissement à l’autre.
      Enivré, il devient violent ou donne l’impression d’avoir totalement perdu la
      raison. Il lui arrive de boire en route vers chez lui en revenant de l’hôpital.
      Peut-être a-t-il déjà connu le delirium tre- mens. Les médecins sont impuissants
      et vous conseillent de le faire enfermer. Vous l’avez peut-être déjà fait interner.
      Ce tableau n’est pas aussi noir qu’il ne le semble. Plusieurs de nos maris semblaient
      être tombés aussi bas. Pourtant, ils s’en sont tirés.\r\nRevenons au mari de
      la première catégorie. Chose curieuse, il est souvent difficile de traiter avec
      lui. Il aime boire. L’alcool stimule son imagination. Ses amis lui semblent
      plus proches devant un verre. Peut-être même que vous aimez prendre un verre
      avec lui quand il ne fait pas d’excès. Vous avez passé de bonnes soi- rées ensemble
      à converser au coin du feu, un verre à la main. Il est possible que tous les
      deux vous aimiez les réunions entre amis qui seraient assommantes sans alcool.
      Nous aussi nous avons pris plaisir à ces soirées et nous nous y sommes amusées.
      Nous connaissons toutes les secrets de l’alcool comme lubrifiant social. Certaines
      d’entre nous, mais pas toutes, croient qu’il y a quelque chose de bon à tirer
      de l’alcool, à condition d’y aller raisonnablement.\r\nLa première condition
      pour réussir est de ne jamais vous mettre en colère. Même si votre mari devient
      insupportable et que vous devez le quitter temporaire- ment, vous devez tâcher
      de partir sans rancœur. Patien- ce et bonne humeur sont absolument nécessaires.\r\nDeuxièmement,
      vous devez vous abstenir de lui dic- ter sa conduite à propos de sa consommation
      d’alcool. S’il se met en tête que vous n’êtes qu’une rabat-joie ou une grogneuse,
      vos chances de faire quelque pro- grès que ce soit pourraient être nulles. Il
      utilisera vos interventions comme excuse pour boire davantage. Il vous dira
      que vous ne le comprenez pas. Cela pourrait vous conduire à passer vos soirées
      seules, car il cher- chera la consolation auprès d’une autre personne, et pas
      toujours auprès d’un autre homme.\r\nSoyez décidée à ne pas laisser l’alcoolisme
      de votre mari ruiner vos relations avec vos enfants ou vos amis. Ils ont besoin
      de votre amitié et de votre aide. Vous pouvez mener une existence utile et bien
      remplie même si votre mari continue de boire. Nous connaissons des femmes qui
      vivent cette situation sans peur et sont même heureuses. Il vaut mieux ne pas
      vous mettre en tête de réformer votre mari. Vous pourriez ne pas réus- sir,
      même en essayant de toutes vos forces.\r\nCes suggestions sont parfois difficiles
      à suivre, nous le reconnaissons, mais elles vous épargneront de cruelles déceptions
      si vous parvenez à les observer. Votre mari finira peut-être par être sensible
      à votre bon sens et à votre patience. Vous êtes peut-être en train de préparer
      le terrain pour un entretien amical avec lui au sujet de son problème d’alcool.
      Essayez de l’ame- ner à aborder lui-même la question. Gardez-vous de le critiquer
      au cours de cette discussion. Efforcez-vous plutôt de vous mettre à sa place.
      Faites en sorte qu’il se rende compte de votre désir de l’aider et non de le
      critiquer.\r\nSi la discussion se présente, vous pourriez lui sug- gérer de
      lire ce livre ou du moins le chapitre traitant de l’alcoolisme. Dites-lui que
      vous vous inquiétez, peut-être inutilement. Ajoutez qu’il serait bon qu’il en
      sache plus long sur le sujet car tout le monde devrait être au courant des risques
      qu’on prend à trop boire. Faites-lui sentir que vous avez confiance en sa capaci-
      té de cesser ou de modérer sa consommation d’alcool. Dites-lui que vous ne voulez
      pas jouer les trouble-fête, mais seulement le voir s’occuper de sa santé. Peut-être
      réussirez-vous à l’intéresser à l’alcoolisme.\r\nIl est probable qu’il compte
      plusieurs alcooliques parmi ses connaissances. Vous pourriez lui suggérer de
      vous occuper ensemble de ces gens-là. Les buveurs aiment bien s’entraider. Votre
      mari aura peut-être envie de parler à l’un d’eux.\r\nSi ce genre d’approche
      n’éveille pas l’intérêt de votre mari, il vaudrait mieux laisser tomber le sujet
      ; cepen- dant, si la conversation a été amicale, c’est votre mari lui-même qui
      ramènera généralement la question sur le tapis. Vous devrez peut-être être patiente
      et attendre longtemps, mais cela en vaut la peine. Vous pourriez, entre-temps,
      essayer de venir en aide à la femme d’un autre gros buveur. Si vous agissez
      selon ces principes, il y a des chances que votre mari cesse de boire ou modère
      sa consommation.\r\nIl se peut que votre conjoint réponde à la descrip- tion
      de la deuxième catégorie. Les principes énoncés pour les cas de la première
      catégorie doivent être appli- qués. Mais après sa prochaine cuite, demandez-lui
      s’il veut vraiment venir à bout de son problème d’alcool. Ne lui demandez pas
      de le faire pour vous ou pour qui que ce soit d’autre. Il s’agit seulement de
      savoir s’il aimerait cesser de boire.\r\nIl y a de bonnes chances qu’il le désire.
      Dans ce cas, montrez-lui ce livre et faites-lui part de ce que vous avez découvert
      au sujet de l’alcoolisme. Men- tionnez que, à titre d’alcooliques, les auteurs
      de ce livre comprennent le problème. Racontez-lui certaines des histoires intéressantes
      que vous avez lues. Si vous croyez que la solution spirituelle le mettra mal
      à l’ai- se, demandez-lui de lire le chapitre sur l’alcoolisme. Peut-être sera-t-il
      assez intéressé pour continuer sa lec- ture.\r\nS’il est enthousiasmé, votre
      coopération comptera pour beaucoup. S’il réagit avec tiédeur ou s’il ne se croit
      pas alcoolique, nous vous suggérons de le laisser tranquille. Évitez de l’inciter
      à suivre notre program- me. L’idée a commencé à germer dans son esprit. Il sait
      que des milliers d’hommes très semblables à lui se sont rétablis. Mais ne le
      lui rappelez pas après qu’il a bu car il pourrait se mettre en colère. Tôt ou
      tard, vous vous apercevrez qu’il a repris sa lecture du livre. Patientez jusqu’à
      ce que ses nombreuses rechutes le convainquent d’agir car plus vous le pousserez,
      plus son rétablissement sera retardé.\r\nSi votre mari appartient à la troisième
      catégorie, vous avez peut-être de la chance. En étant certaine qu’il veut cesser
      de boire, vous pouvez lui présenter ce livre aussi joyeusement que si vous veniez
      de découvrir une mine d’or. Il ne partagera peut-être pas votre enthousiasme,
      mais il est presque certain qu’il lira le livre et il pourrait décider d’adopter
      le mode de vie sur-le-champ. Si ce n’est pas le cas, vous n’aurez peut-être
      pas longtemps à attendre. Encore une fois, vous ne devez pas le bousculer. Laissez-le
      décider lui-même. Réjouissez-vous au contraire de le voir prendre d’autres cuites.
      Ne parlez de sa condition ou de ce livre que lorsque lui-même aborde le sujet.
      Dans certains cas, il peut être préférable de lais- ser quelqu’un d’extérieur
      à la famille lui présenter le livre. Cela peut le pousser à agir sans provoquer
      l’hosti- lité. Si, autrement, votre mari est une personne normale, vos chances
      de le voir s’en sortir sont bonnes.\r\nOn pourrait croire que les hommes de
      la quatrième catégorie sont des cas désespérés, mais ce n’est pas vrai. Beaucoup
      de membres des Alcooliques anonymes étaient ainsi. Ils avaient été abandonnés
      de tous. La défaite sem- blait certaine. Souvent, pourtant, ces hommes ont connu
      un rétablissement solide et spectaculaire.\r\nIl y a des exceptions. Certains
      hommes ont été tel- lement affectés par l’alcool qu’ils ne peuvent pas s’en
      sortir. Parfois, on rencontre des cas où l’alcoolisme se complique d’autres
      désordres. Un bon médecin ou un bon psychiatre est en mesure de vous dire si
      de telles complications sont graves. Quoi qu’il en soit, essayez de faire lire
      ce livre à votre mari. Il pourrait soulever son enthousiasme. S’il est déjà
      admis dans un établis- sement et s’il peut vous convaincre, vous et le méde-
      cin, qu’il est sérieux dans ses intentions de se rétablir, donnez-lui une chance
      d’essayer notre méthode, à moins que le médecin ne juge sa condition trop anor-
      male ou dangereuse. C’est en toute confiance que nous faisons cette recommandation.
      Voilà des années que nous travaillons avec des alcooliques soignés dans des
      maisons de santé. Depuis la sortie de ce livre, les AA ont tiré des milliers
      d’alcooliques d’asiles et d’hôpi- taux de tous genres. La majorité d’entre eux
      n’y sont jamais retournés. Dieu a le bras long !\r\nVotre situation est peut-être
      l’inverse de la précé- dente. Votre mari est en liberté mais il devrait être
      interné. Certains hommes ne peuvent pas ou ne veu- lent pas surmonter leur problème
      d’alcool. Lorsque ces hommes deviennent trop dangereux, nous pensons qu’il faut
      les faire enfermer, mais jamais sans avoir d’abord consulté un bon médecin.
      Les femmes et les enfants de ces hommes souffrent horriblement, mais pas plus
      que ces hommes eux-mêmes.\r\nCependant il arrive que les conjointes doivent
      refai- re leur vie. Nous en connaissons qui l’ont fait. La route sera plus facile
      pour elles si elles adoptent un mode de vie spirituel.\r\nSi vous êtes mariée
      à un buveur, vous vous inquié- tez probablement de l’opinion des gens et vous
      avez horreur de rencontrer vos amis. Vous vous repliez de plus en plus sur vous-même
      et croyez que tout le monde parle de ce qui se passe chez vous. Vous évitez
      la ques- tion de l’alcool, même avec vos parents. Vous ne savez pas quoi dire
      aux enfants. Lorsque votre mari n’est pas bien, vous restez dans votre coin,
      tremblante, et vous souhaitez que le téléphone n’ait jamais été inventé.\r\nCet
      embarras, nous semble-t-il, n’est pas nécessaire. Même si vous n’avez pas besoin
      de vous éterniser sur la condition de votre mari, vous pouvez exposer tran-
      quillement à vos amis la nature de sa maladie. Vous devez cependant prendre
      garde de ne pas lui nuire.\r\nLe fait d’avoir bien expliqué aux gens que votre
      mari est malade aura créé une nouvelle ambiance. Les bar- rières qui s’étaient
      érigées entre vous et vos amis dis- paraîtront pour faire place à la sympathie
      et à la compréhension. Vous ne serez plus intimidée et vous ne vous sentirez
      plus obligée de vous excuser de la fai- blesse de caractère de votre mari. En
      fait, il se peut qu’il ait tous les défauts, sauf celui-là. Votre nouveau courage,
      votre bon caractère et votre maîtrise feront des merveilles pour vous en société.\r\nLa
      même attitude s’applique dans les rapports avec les enfants. À moins qu’ils
      aient vraiment besoin d’être protégés contre leur père, il vaut mieux ne pas
      prendre parti dans les discussions qui les opposent à lui lors- qu’il boit.
      Employez votre énergie à promouvoir la compréhension autour de vous. Ainsi,
      la terrible ten- sion qui existe dans les foyers de tous les buveurs dimi- nuera
      chez vous.\r\nVous vous êtes souvent sentie obligée de répondre à l’employeur
      ou aux amis de votre mari qu’il était malade alors qu’en fait il était soûl.
      Évitez autant que possible d’avoir à répondre à des questions investiga- trices.
      Quand cela est possible, laissez votre conjoint s’expliquer. Votre désir de
      le protéger ne devrait pas vous entraîner à mentir à des gens qui ont le droit
      de connaître ses faits et gestes. Discutez-en avec lui lors- qu’il est abstinent
      et de bonne humeur. Demandez-lui ce que vous devez faire la prochaine fois qu’il
      vous mettra dans une position semblable. Cependant, prenez soin de ne pas lui
      manifester de ressentiment à propos de la dernière fois où ce scénario s’est
      produit.\r\nUne autre sorte de peur peut vous paralyser. Vous pouvez craindre
      que votre mari perde son emploi ; vous pensez à la honte et à la vie dure qui
      vous guet- tent, vous et les enfants. Ils se pourrait que vous en fassiez l’
      expérience. Ou peut-être l’ avez-vous déjà vécue plusieurs fois. Si cette situation
      se reproduit, tâchez de l’envisager sous un nouvel angle. Vous en retirerez
      peut-être un grand bienfait ! Cela pourrait faire prendre conscience à votre
      mari qu’il veut cesser à jamais de boire. Et maintenant vous savez qu’il peut
      renoncer à boire s’il le veut ! Combien de fois cette apparente calamité n’a-t-elle
      pas été une bénédiction pour nous, car elle nous a ouvert un chemin qui mène
      à la découverte de Dieu.\r\nNous avons mentionné ailleurs dans ce livre que
      l’existence est bien meilleure lorsqu’on la vit sur une base spirituelle. Si
      Dieu peut résoudre l’énigme sécu- laire de l’alcoolisme, Il peut également régler
      vos pro- blèmes. Nous, femmes d’ alcooliques, nous avons constaté que comme
      tous les autres, nous avons été affligées par l’orgueil, l’apitoiement, la vanité
      et tout ce qui fait qu’une personne devient égocentrique ; et nous n’étions
      exemptes ni d’égoïsme ni de malhonnê- teté. Lorsque nos maris ont commencé à
      vivre selon des principes spirituels, nous avons commencé à voir combien il
      serait bon que nous en fassions autant.\r\nAu début, certaines parmi nous refusaient
      de croire que nous avions besoin de cette aide. Nous croyions que dans l’ensemble,
      nous étions des femmes bien et que nous pourrions l’être davantage si nos maris
      ces- saient de boire. Mais c’était une idée bien étrange de croire que nous
      étions trop bonnes pour avoir besoin de Dieu. Maintenant, nous essayons de mettre
      en pra- tique les principes spirituels dans tous les domaines de notre vie.
      En agissant ainsi, nous constatons que cela résout également nos problèmes.
      Quelle merveille que de voir la fin de notre peur, de nos soucis et de nos peines.
      Nous vous recommandons fortement de suivre notre programme car rien n’aidera
      plus votre mari que le changement radical de votre conduite envers lui, conduite
      que Dieu se chargera de vous dicter. Marchez de pair avec votre mari si la chose
      est possible.\r\nSi vous et votre mari trouvez une solution au pro- blème aigu
      de l’alcool, il est certain que vous serez très heureux. Cependant toutes les
      difficultés ne seront pas résolues du même coup. La semence vient tout juste
      de germer dans un nouveau sol mais la croissance com- mence à peine. En dépit
      de votre bonheur neuf, il y aura des hauts et des bas. Plusieurs de vos difficultés
      d’autre- fois seront toujours là. Et il doit en être ainsi.\r\nLa foi et la
      sincérité de tous deux seront mises à l’épreuve. Ces nouvelles situations devraient
      être per- çues comme partie intégrante de votre éducation puisque vous réapprendrez
      à vivre. Vous commettrez des erreurs mais si vous êtes très convaincue, vous
      ne serez pas démolie pour autant. Vous en tirerez plutôt profit. Une vie meilleure
      s’offrira à vous lorsque vous aurez surmonté ces difficultés.\r\nL’irritation,
      les déceptions et le ressentiment seront des obstacles que vous rencontrerez.
      Votre mari man- quera parfois de jugement et vous serez tentée de le critiquer.
      Du petit point noir à l’horizon pourrait sur- gir une tempête de discussions.
      Ces dissensions fami- liales sont très dangereuses, surtout pour votre mari.
      Souvent, la tâche vous reviendra d’éviter ces discus- sions ou d’en maîtriser
      le cours. N’oubliez jamais que le ressentiment est un risque mortel pour un
      alcoolique. Nous ne voulons pas dire que vous deviez approuver votre conjoint
      toutes les fois que vous avez une bonne raison d’avoir une opinion différente.
      Prenez simple- ment garde de ne pas exprimer votre désaccord dans un esprit
      de critique ou de ressentiment.\r\nVous et votre mari découvrirez que vous pouvez
      régler les problèmes graves plus facilement que les petites difficultés. La
      prochaine fois qu’une vive dis- cussion s’élèvera entre vous et votre mari,
      peu impor- te le sujet, l’un ou l’autre devrait se sentir libre de sourire et
      de dire : « La discussion devient grave. Excuse mon emportement. Nous en reparlerons
      plus tard. » Si votre mari s’efforce de vivre selon des prin- cipes spirituels,
      lui aussi fera tout ce qu’il pourra pour éviter les conflits ou les disputes.\r\nVotre
      mari sait que sa dette envers vous ne se limi- te pas à l’abstinence. Il veut
      se rattraper. Toutefois vous ne devez pas attendre trop de lui. Ses façons de
      pen- ser et d’agir sont des habitudes qui datent de plusieurs années. Patience,
      tolérance, compréhension et amour sont les mots d’ordre. Donnez-en l’exemple
      vous-même et vous verrez qu’en retour, votre mari les fera siens. La règle est
      de vivre et de laisser vivre. Si chacun se montre disposé à corriger ses défauts,
      vous aurez peu de raisons de critiquer l’autre.\r\nNous, les femmes, nous nous
      faisons une image de l’homme idéal auquel, pensons-nous, notre mari devrait
      ressembler. Et, chose on ne peut plus naturelle, nous croyons que nos maris,
      une fois leur problème d’alcool réglé, vont se montrer à la hauteur de l’idéal
      que nous caressons. Mais cela risque peu de se produire, car, comme vous, votre
      mari ne fait que commencer à évo- luer. Soyez patiente.\r\nIl est aussi fort
      probable que nous cultivions du res- sentiment à l’idée que notre amour et notre
      loyauté envers nos conjoints n’ont pas réussi à les sortir de leur alcoolisme.
      Nous n’aimons pas penser que le contenu d’un livre ou l’intervention d’un autre
      alcoo- lique aient accompli en quelques semaines ce pour quoi nous avons lutté
      pendant des années. C’est que nous oublions qu’il était impossible pour nous
      d’exercer un quelconque pouvoir sur une maladie comme l’alcoo- lisme. Votre
      mari sera le premier à reconnaître que s’il a été amené à vivre une expérience
      spirituelle, c’est grâce à vos soins constants et attentifs. Sans vous, dira-
      t-il, il serait depuis longtemps devenu une loque. Lorsque le ressentiment vous
      assaille, faites une pause et tâchez de faire le compte des éléments positifs.
      Après tout, votre famille est réunie, l’alcool ne pose plus de problème et vous
      et votre mari travaillez ensemble à bâtir un avenir dont vous n’aviez même jamais
      rêvé.\r\nIl est possible qu’une autre difficulté se présente : vous pourriez
      être jalouse de l’attention que votre mari porte à d’autres personnes, surtout
      aux alcooliques. Après avoir tellement désiré sa présence à vos côtés, voilà
      qu’il passe de longues heures à aider d’autres per- sonnes et d’autres familles.
      Il devrait rester près de vous maintenant, pensez-vous. N’oubliez pas que s’il
      veut demeurer sobre, il doit travailler au rétablissement d’autres alcooliques.
      Il s’engage parfois tellement dans ce travail envers les autres qu’il vous néglige
      effecti- vement. Votre maison est pleine d’inconnus. Certains d’entre eux peuvent
      ne pas vous plaire. Votre mari s’émeut de leurs problèmes mais les vôtres ne
      le tou- chent pas. Cela ne servirait pas à grand-chose de le lui faire remarquer
      et d’insister pour qu’il s’occupe de vous. À notre avis, c’est une véritable
      erreur de refroi- dir son enthousiasme pour la cause de l’alcoolique. Il vaut
      mieux essayer de vous joindre à lui dans ses efforts. Par exemple, vous pourriez
      vous dévouer auprès des femmes des nouveaux amis alcooliques de votre mari.
      Elles ont besoin des conseils et de l’ami- tié d’une femme qui a vécu la même
      expérience que vous.\r\nIl se peut que vous et votre mari ayez été trop seuls,
      car la boisson isole souvent la femme de l’alcoolique. Par conséquent, il est
      probable que vous ayez besoin autant que votre conjoint de vous intéresser à
      quelque chose de nouveau et de vivre pour une grande cause. Si vous coopérez
      plutôt que de vous plaindre, vous verrez se cal- mer son enthousiasme excessif.
      Ensemble, vous décou- vrirez un nouveau sens de vos responsabilités envers les
      autres. Il faut que vous et votre mari pensiez à ce que vous pouvez apporter
      à la vie au lieu de songer à ce que vous pouvez en retirer. Vos vies en seront
      inévitablement plus riches. Vous perdrez votre ancienne façon de vivre pour
      une autre bien meilleure.\r\nIl se pourrait que votre mari s’engage correctement
      sur la bonne voie, mais que juste au moment où les choses vont merveilleusement
      bien, il vous plonge dans la consternation en rentrant ivre à la maison. Si
      vous croyez qu’il a vraiment l’intention d’arrêter de boire, il n’y a pas de
      raison de vous en faire. Bien sûr, il vaut infiniment mieux n’avoir aucune rechute,
      comme c’est le cas d’un grand nombre de nos membres, mais cela n’est pas du
      tout mauvais dans certains cas. Votre mari verra tout de suite qu’il doit redoubler
      d’ardeur dans ses activités spirituelles s’il veut survivre. Inutile de lui
      rappeler ses manquements spirituels, il en sera conscient. Tâchez de lui remonter
      le moral et deman- dez-lui ce que vous pourriez faire pour l’aider davan- tage.\r\nLe
      moindre indice de peur ou d’intolérance peut réduire ses chances de se rétablir.
      Dans un moment de faiblesse, il pourrait se remettre à boire, prenant comme
      excuse absurde le fait que vous n’aimez pas ses amis envahissants.\r\nJamais,
      au grand jamais, nous n’essayons d’interve- nir dans la vie d’un homme pour
      le tenir à l’abri de la tentation. Il s’apercevra de la moindre tentative de
      votre part pour arranger ses rendez-vous ou ses affaires de manière à ce qu’il
      ne soit pas tenté de boire. Faites- lui sentir qu’il est absolument libre d’aller
      et de venir à sa guise. C’est important. S’il se soûle, ne vous faites pas de
      reproches. Ou bien Dieu a libéré votre mari de son problème d’alcool, ou bien
      Il ne l’a pas libéré. Si le problème n’est pas réglé, il vaut mieux le savoir
      tout de suite. Alors, ensemble, vous reviendrez aux prin- cipes de base. Si
      vous voulez éviter une rechute, remet- tez ce problème, et tout le reste, entre
      les mains de Dieu.\r\nNous sommes conscients de vous avoir donné beau- coup
      de conseils et de marches à suivre. Vous avez peut-être eu l’impression que
      nous vous faisions la morale. Si c’est le cas, veuillez nous en excuser car
      de notre côté, nous n’aimons pas beaucoup non plus être sermonnés. Ce que nous
      vous avons raconté repose sur nos expériences, dont certaines ont été pénibles.
      Nous avons dû apprendre tout cela à nos dépens. C’est pour- quoi nous souhaitons
      ardemment que vous compren- drez, pour vous épargner des difficultés inutiles.*\r\nAlors,
      à vous qui nous lisez et qui serez peut-être des nôtres prochainement, nous
      disons : « Bonne chance, et que Dieu vous bénisse ! »\r\n"

    - LA FAMILLE ET LE RÉT ABLISSEMENT
    - "Nos amies dans l’association ont suggéré des attitudes à adopter par une femme
      envers un mari alcoolique en voie de rétablissement. Peut-être ont-elles donné
      l’impression que le mari doit être mis à l’abri dans un cocon et placé sur un
      piédestal. C’est le contraire qu’il faut faire si l’on veut réussir. Tous les
      membres de la famille doivent s’entendre pour faire preuve de tolérance, de
      compréhension et d’amour. Ceci fait appel à un processus de dégonflement. L’al-
      coolique, tout comme sa femme, ses enfants, sa belle- famille ont tous probablement
      des idées bien arrêtées sur l’attitude que la famille doit adopter à son égard.
      Chacun ou chacune veut voir ses désirs respectés. Il est intéressant de remarquer
      que plus un membre de la famille exige de concessions des autres, plus ceux-ci
      nourrissent du ressentiment. Ainsi naissent la discorde et le malheur.\r\nPourquoi
      ? N’est-ce pas parce que chacun veut mener ? N’est-ce pas parce que chacun tente
      d’arran- ger la situation familiale selon son goût ? Chaque per- sonne concernée
      ne cherche-t-elle pas à voir ce qu’elle pourrait tirer de la famille au lieu
      de songer à ce qu’el- le pourrait lui apporter ?\r\nCesser de boire n’est que
      la première étape pour tirer la famille d’une situation anormale très tendue.
      Un médecin nous a déclaré : « À force de vivre pendant des années avec un alcoolique,
      une femme ou un enfant devient presque inévitablement névrosé. Jusqu’à un cer-
      tain point, la famille entière est malade. » Les familles doivent comprendre,
      lorsqu’elles s’engagent sur la voie du rétablissement, que tout ne sera pas
      rose. Chacun à tour de rôle sera peut-être blessé et restera en arrière. Il
      se peut que certains s’égarent, séduits par des rac- courcis et des voies faciles.\r\nNous
      nous permettons de vous indiquer quelques- uns des obstacles qui guettent une
      famille et de vous suggérer des moyens de les éviter, comment même les transformer
      à l’avantage des autres. La famille d’un alcoolique souhaite retrouver le bonheur
      et la sécurité. Chacun se souvient du temps où papa se montrait romantique et
      attentionné, du temps où il réussissait. La vie présente est comparée à celle
      qu’on avait aupa- ravant et si le bilan est négatif, la famille peut en être
      malheureuse.\r\nLa famille reprend énormément confiance envers le père. Bientôt,
      croit-on, les jours heureux reviendront. Parfois on exige que papa ramène le
      bonheur immé- diatement ! Dieu, pense-t-on, nous doit bien cette récompense
      méritée depuis longtemps. Mais après avoir passé des années à miner l’état de
      ses affaires, de sa vie amoureuse, de ses amitiés et de sa santé, le chef de
      famille a fini par ruiner ou mettre tout cela sérieu- sement en péril. Il faudra
      du temps pour se remettre du naufrage. Même s’il arrive que les anciens édifices
      soient remplacés par de plus beaux, il faudra toutefois des années pour compléter
      les nouvelles structures.\r\nLe père sait que tout est sa faute ; il devra sans
      doute travailler durement et longtemps pour se rétablir financièrement, mais
      on doit éviter de lui faire des reproches. Peut-être n’aura-t-il plus jamais
      beaucoup d’argent. Mais une famille bien avisée lui démontrera de l’admiration
      pour ce qu’il tente d’accomplir plutôt que pour ce qu’il tente d’acquérir.\r\nDe
      temps à autre, les spectres du passé viendront harceler la famille car la vie
      de presque tous les alcoo- liques est marquée par des escapades tantôt drôles,
      tan- tôt humiliantes, honteuses ou tragiques. On sera d’abord tenté de reléguer
      ces mauvais souvenirs aux oubliettes pour ne plus jamais en parler. La famille
      sera peut-être obsédée par l’idée que tout bonheur à venir ne peut se construire
      que sur l’oubli du passé. Nous considérons ce point de vue comme égocentrique
      et directement en conflit avec notre nouveau mode de vie.\r\nHenry Ford a déjà
      fait sagement observer que l’ex- périence est la valeur capitale dans la vie.
      Cet énoncé est vrai seulement si l’on se montre disposé à tirer pro- fit du
      passé. Nous grandissons par notre volonté de regarder nos fautes en face, de
      les corriger et de les tourner à notre avantage. Ainsi, le passé de l’alcoo-
      lique devient l’atout principal de la famille et souvent, il est presque le
      seul !\r\nLe passé douloureux d’une famille peut être d’une valeur infinie pour
      d’autres encore aux prises avec leur problème. À notre avis, toute famille aujourd’hui
      libérée a une dette envers celles qui ne le sont pas et lorsque la situation
      le requiert, chaque membre de cette famille devrait accepter de déterrer les
      erreurs passées, si doulou- reuses soient-elles. Montrer à ceux qui souffrent
      la somme d’aide que nous avons reçue constitue la chose qui semble nous rendre
      la vie si précieuse aujourd’hui. Accrochez-vous à l’idée que, dans les mains
      de Dieu, votre noir passé est ce que vous possédez de plus précieux : la clé
      de la vie et du bonheur des autres. Avec cette clé, vous pourrez les sauver
      de la misère et de la mort.\r\nIl se peut aussi qu’on déterre les fautes du
      passé d’une façon telle qu’elles puissent devenir des fléaux ou de véritables
      plaies. Prenons, par exemple, les cas où l’alcoolique et sa femme ont connu
      des aventures amoureuses. Dans le premier élan de l’expérience spi- rituelle,
      les conjoints ont pardonné et se sont rappro- chés. Le miracle de la réconciliation
      allait se produire. Puis, sous le coup d’une provocation quelconque, dans sa
      colère, celui qui se sent lésé ressuscite l’aventure passée et remet les torts
      de l’autre sur le tapis. Quelques-uns d’entre nous ont éprouvé ce type de dou-
      leurs qui font très mal. Parfois les conjoints ont dû se séparer quelque temps
      jusqu’à ce qu’ils parviennent à se regarder d’un autre œil et à surmonter le
      coup porté à leur orgueil. La plupart du temps, mais pas toujours, l’alcoolique
      traverse cette épreuve sans rechuter. C’est pourquoi nous croyons qu’à moins
      d’avoir une raison valable de le faire, il ne faut pas discuter des événe- ments
      passés.\r\nDans les familles des Alcooliques anonymes, nous gardons peu de faits
      cachés. Chacun connaît les pro- blèmes des autres alcooliques. Dans la vie courante,
      un tel état de chose entraînerait d’énormes ennuis ; les gens pourraient rapporter
      des scandales, s’amuser aux dépens des autres et tenter de profiter d’informations
      de nature intime. Ces choses-là se produisent rarement entre nous. Bien sûr,
      nous parlons beaucoup les uns des autres, mais nos propos sont presque toujours
      tem- pérés par un esprit d’amour et de tolérance.\r\nUn autre principe observé
      scrupuleusement par nos membres veut que nous ne racontions pas les expé- riences
      intimes d’une autre personne à moins d’être certain qu’elle y consentirait.
      Il est préférable, croyons- nous, de nous en tenir généralement au récit de
      nos propres vies. Chacun, en analysant ses actions ou en se moquant de lui-même,
      peut influencer favorablement les autres, mais critiquer une tierce personne
      ou se moquer d’elle produit souvent l’effet contraire. Il est important que
      les membres de chaque famille soient vigilants à ce sujet, car il suffit d’une
      remarque irré- fléchie et désobligeante pour mettre le feu aux poudres. Nous,
      les alcooliques, sommes des gens susceptibles. Certains d’entre nous mettent
      du temps à surmonter ce grave handicap.\r\nNombre d’alcooliques sont des enthousiastes.
      Ils passent d’un extrême à l’autre. En général, aux pre- miers stades de son
      rétablissement, un homme choi- sit entre deux directions : ou bien il se plonge
      frénétiquement dans ses affaires pour les redresser, ou bien il est tellement
      emballé par sa nouvelle vie qu’il ne pense et ne parle à peu près plus d’autre
      chose. L’une ou l’autre attitude entraîne certains pro- blèmes familiaux. Ce
      sont des situations que nous avons souvent expérimentées.\r\nÀ notre avis, il
      est dangereux pour l’alcoolique de se lancer tête baissée pour résoudre ses
      difficultés éco- nomiques. La famille est également concernée ; au début, elle
      voit venir la fin de ses soucis d’argent et s’en réjouit, mais le plaisir est
      moins grand lorsqu’el- le s’aperçoit qu’elle est négligée. Papa est fatigué
      le soir et préoccupé durant la journée. Il porte peu d’at- tention aux enfants
      et s’irrite lorsqu’on lui reproche ses négligences. S’il n’est pas irritable,
      il semble amorphe et ennuyeux, ne démontrant pas la gaieté et l’affection que
      sa famille attend de lui. Maman se plaint peut-être d’un manque d’attention.
      Tous les membres de la famil- le sont déçus et le lui font sentir. Avec l’expression
      de ces plaintes, une barrière s’élève. Le chef de famille dépense toute son
      énergie à rattraper le temps perdu. Il s’esquinte à rebâtir sa situation financière
      et sa répu- tation, et il lui semble qu’il va bien.\r\nCe n’est pas parfois
      l’avis de la mère et des enfants. Ayant été négligés et maltraités dans le passé,
      ils esti- ment que papa leur doit plus que ce qu’ils reçoivent. Le père devrait
      être aux petits soins avec eux, pensent- ils. On attend de lui qu’il fasse revivre
      les bons moments du temps où il buvait moins, qu’il démontre combien il se repent
      pour les souffrances qu’il a cau- sées à sa famille. Mais papa ne se donne pas
      sans comp- ter aux siens. Le ressentiment augmente. Il est encore moins communicatif
      qu’avant. Parfois il s’emporte pour une bagatelle. La famille est déroutée.
      On le critique en faisant remarquer qu’il manque à son programme spirituel.\r\nOn
      peut éviter ce genre de situation. Tout le monde, ici, est dans l’erreur, même
      si l’attitude de chacun peut être quelque peu justifiée. Se disputer ne sert
      à rien et ne peut qu’approfondir l’impasse. La famille doit com- prendre que
      papa, même si son comportement s’est merveilleusement amélioré, est encore en
      convales- cence. Elle doit se montrer reconnaissante devant sa sobriété et du
      fait qu’il soit toujours en vie. Il faut le féliciter pour le progrès réalisé.
      Son alcoolisme a causé toutes sortes de dommages qu’il peut être long de répa-
      rer, ne l’oublions pas. Si la famille en est consciente, les périodes d’irritation,
      de dépression ou d’apathie lui sembleront moins graves et celles-ci disparaîtront
      sous l’effet de la tolérance, de l’amour et de la compré- hension des principes
      spirituels.\r\nLe chef de famille devrait se rappeler que c’est lui le grand
      responsable de ce qui est arrivé au foyer. Il aura à peine le temps, au cours
      de toute sa vie, de mettre ses comptes en ordre. Cependant, il doit être conscient
      du danger de trop se concentrer sur sa réus- site financière. Nombre d’entre
      nous sont en voie de se sortir pour de bon de leurs dettes, mais nous nous sommes
      rendu compte que nous ne pouvions pas faire passer l’argent en premier. Pour
      nous, le bien-être maté- riel vient toujours après le progrès spirituel, jamais
      avant.\r\nLa famille étant ce qui a le plus souffert, il convient que le père
      concentre ses efforts sur les siens. Il a peu de chance de progresser dans quelque
      direction que ce soit s’il ne parvient pas à démontrer générosité et amour sous
      son propre toit. Nous savons qu’il y a des femmes et des familles difficiles,
      mais l’homme en voie de réta- blissement doit se rappeler qu’il a beaucoup contribué
      à les rendre ainsi.\r\nÀ mesure que chaque membre d’une famille pleine de ressentiment
      commence à prendre conscience de ses fai- blesses et à les admettre devant les
      autres, il prépare le terrain pour une discussion fructueuse. Ces explications
      en famille seront constructives dans la mesure où elles pourront se dérouler
      sans emportement, ni apitoiement, ni justifications, ni critiques amères. Petit
      à petit, la mère et les enfants se rendront compte qu’ils demandent trop, et
      le père, qu’il ne donne pas assez. Donner au lieu de recevoir deviendra le principe
      directeur.\r\nSupposons, d’un autre côté, que dès le début, le père vive une
      expérience spirituelle exaltante. Du jour au lendemain, il n’est plus le même
      homme. Il devient un fervent de la religion. Il est incapable de concentrer
      son attention sur autre chose. Dès que son abstinence commencera à être perçue
      comme un fait acquis, la famille regardera peut-être avec appréhension, puis
      irri- tation, ce père nouveau et étrange. Matin, midi et soir, il est question
      de spiritualité. Le père pourrait exiger que la famille se tourne vers Dieu
      rapidement, ou enco- re démontrer de l’indifférence envers les siens, pro- clamant
      qu’ il est au-dessus des considérations matérielles. Il est possible qu’il fasse
      remarquer à la mère les lacunes de ses connaissances sur la religion, même si
      elle a été dévote toute sa vie, et qu’il l’en- courage à s’adonner à son genre
      de spiritualité, pen- dant qu’il en est encore temps.\r\nQuand le père s’oriente
      dans cette direction, il peut arriver que la famille réagisse de façon défavorable.
      Elle et les enfants pourraient se montrer jaloux d’un Dieu qui leur a volé l’affection
      paternelle. Bien que reconnaissants parce que leur père a cessé de boire, l’idée
      que Dieu a accompli un miracle là où eux avaient échoué pourrait leur déplaire.
      Souvent ils oublient qu’aucune aide humaine ne pouvait sauver leur père. Il
      est possible qu’ils ne comprennent pas pourquoi, mal- gré leur amour et leur
      dévouement, ils n’ont pas réus- si à ramener leur père sur la bonne voie. Après
      tout, papa n’est pas tellement du type spirituel, disent-ils. S’il veut redresser
      ses torts, pourquoi se soucie-t-il tant de tout le monde, sauf de sa famille
      ? Que penser lors- qu’il prétend que Dieu en prendra soin à la place ? Ils soupçonnent
      alors leur père de ne pas avoir toute sa tête !\r\nMais ce dernier n’est pas
      aussi déséquilibré qu’ils pourraient le croire. Beaucoup d’entre nous ont éprou-
      vé la même exaltation. Nous nous sommes adonnés à l’intoxication spirituelle.
      Nous étions comme le pros- pecteur affamé qui, se serrant la ceinture devant
      ses dernières réserves de nourriture, finit par trouver un filon d’or. Notre
      joie d’avoir échappé à une vie de frus- trations était sans borne. C’est comme
      si papa avait découvert quelque chose d’encore mieux que l’or. Pen- dant un
      certain temps, il sera tenté de chérir ce trésor et de le garder pour lui seul.
      Il ne verra pas tout de suite qu’il a, en fait, déterré le petit bout d’une
      veine sans fin et que ce filon ne rapportera des dividendes que s’il continue
      de l’exploiter pour le restant de ses jours en cédant tout le produit aux autres.\r\nSi
      la famille coopère, le père se rendra vite compte que son échelle de valeurs
      est déplacée. Il s’apercevra qu’il fait fausse route dans sa croissance spirituelle,
      que pour un homme dans la moyenne comme lui, une vie spirituelle n’incluant
      pas les obligations familiales n’est peut-être pas si parfaite après tout. Tout
      ira bien si la famille accepte de ne voir, dans le comportement actuel du père,
      qu’une phase de l’évolution de celui-ci. Dans un climat familial de compréhension
      et de sympathie, les caprices des débuts spirituels du père disparaîtront rapidement.\r\nMais
      c’est le contraire qui peut se produire si la famille condamne le père et le
      critique. Après des années pendant lesquelles, à cause de son alcoolisme, papa
      a eu le mauvais bout du bâton dans chaque affron- tement, il a maintenant le
      sentiment qu’avec Dieu à ses côtés, il s’est hissé au-dessus des autres. Si
      la famille persiste à le critiquer, il se confortera dans cette pré- tention.
      Plutôt que de traiter sa famille comme il le devrait, le père se repliera davantage
      sur lui-même et se sentira spirituellement justifié d’agir ainsi.\r\nMême si
      les membres de la famille n’approuvent pas complètement les activités spirituelles
      du père, il vaut mieux qu’ils le laissent faire à sa guise. Même s’il pèche
      par un certain degré de négligence et d’irres- ponsabilité, il est recommandé
      de le laisser pousser aussi loin qu’il le désire son action auprès des autres
      alcooliques. Dans ses premiers jours de convalescence alcoolique, il n’y a pas
      de meilleure garantie d’absti- nence. Même si certains de ses comportements
      sont alarmants et désagréables, nous croyons que, pour le père, ce point de
      départ est plus sûr que s’il plaçait la réussite professionnelle ou financière
      avant le progrès spirituel. Ainsi, il sera moins porté à recommencer à boire
      et cela vaut mieux que toute autre chose.\r\nCeux d’entre nous qui sont restés
      longtemps dans le monde de l’illusion spirituelle ont fini par en décou- vrir
      le caractère puéril. Ce monde de rêve a fait place à un désir profond d’ utilité,
      accompagné d’ une conscience toujours plus vive de la présence de Dieu dans
      nos vies. Dieu, en sommes-nous venus à le croi- re, aimerait que nous gardions
      la tête près de Lui, mais que nous maintenions nos pieds solidement posés sur
      le sol. C’est à ce niveau que se trouvent nos compa- gnons de voyage et c’est
      sur ce plan que nous devons intervenir. Voilà où se trouve notre réalité. Nous
      nous sommes aperçus qu’il n’y avait rien d’incompatible entre une expérience
      spirituelle intense et une vie saine et heureuse employée à nous rendre utiles.\r\nAutre
      suggestion : que les membres de la famille aient ou non des convictions spirituelles,
      ils feraient bien de se pencher sur les principes que l’alcoolique essaie de
      mettre en pratique. Ils ne pourront guère man- quer d’approuver ces préceptes
      simples, même si le maître de maison ne les applique pas encore à la per- fection.
      Rien n’aidera plus l’homme lancé sur la voie spirituelle que de voir sa femme
      adopter un bon pro- gramme de spiritualité et le vivre mieux que lui.\r\nD’autres
      changements profonds vont se produire à la maison. Le père ayant été détruit
      par l’alcool pen- dant de nombreuses années, la mère est devenue le chef de
      la famille. Elle a vaillamment fait face à cette res- ponsabilité. Les circonstances
      l’ont forcée à traiter le père comme une personne malade ou comme un enfant
      capricieux. Même quand il voulait s’affirmer, il n’y parvenait pas, son alcoolisme
      lui donnant toujours tort. C’est à la mère qu’incombait la tâche de tout planifier
      et de donner les directives. Lorsqu’il n’avait pas bu, le père obéissait généralement.
      Ainsi, sans qu’elle ne l’ait voulu, la mère s’est habituée à porter la culotte
      dans le ménage. Lorsque le père renaît soudain à la vie, il arrive souvent qu’il
      veuille s’affirmer de nouveau. Des problèmes s’ensuivront à moins que les membres
      de la famille n’essaient chacun pour soi de réprimer sa ten- dance à dominer,
      et qu’ils ne réussissent à régler ces différends à l’amiable.\r\nL’alcoolisme
      isole du reste du monde la plupart des ménages qu’il touche. Le père peut avoir
      mis de côté pendant des années toute activité normale comme la participation
      à des clubs sociaux, à des associations de citoyens ou encore la pratique des
      sports. Lorsqu’il montre de nouveau de l’intérêt pour ces occupations, il peut
      arriver que cela suscite un sentiment de jalou- sie. La famille prétend que
      le père lui doit tellement qu’il est de son devoir de se consacrer exclusivement
      à elle. Au lieu de participer eux-mêmes à de nouvelles activités, la mère et
      les enfants exigent du père une présence quasi continue à la maison afin de
      rattraper le temps perdu.\r\nTout au début, le couple ferait bien de se faire
      à l’idée que chacun devra faire ici et là des concessions si la famille entend
      jouer un rôle efficace dans la nou- velle vie qui s’annonce. Le père passera
      nécessaire- ment beaucoup de temps avec d’autres alcooliques, mais cette activité
      devrait être équilibrée. Le ménage devrait lier connaissance avec des gens qui
      ne savent rien de l’alcoolisme et être très attentifs à leurs besoins. Il pourrait
      également donner de son temps au service de la communauté. Même si la famille
      n’est pas pra- tiquante, elle peut vouloir entrer en contact avec un groupe
      religieux et même en devenir membre.\r\nCes relations pourraient apporter beaucoup
      aux alcooliques qui se moquaient de ceux qui ont des convictions religieuses.
      À cause de son expérience spi- rituelle, l’alcoolique trouvera qu’il a beaucoup
      en com- mun avec ces hommes et ces femmes, même s’il n’est pas d’accord sur
      plusieurs points. S’il ne soulève pas de discussions au sujet de la religion,
      il se fera de nou- veaux amis et, chose certaine, découvrira de nouvelles façons
      de se rendre utile et de se distraire. Lui et sa famille peuvent prendre une
      place importante au sein de ces organisations. Il peut apporter un renouveau
      d’espoir et de courage à nombre de prêtres, pasteurs ou rabbins qui consacrent
      le meilleur d’eux-mêmes à servir notre monde bouleversé. Nous vous proposons
      ce qui précède seulement à titre de suggestions. En ce qui nous concerne, nous
      n’y voyons pas d’obligation. Nous ne sommes d’aucune confession ; nous ne cher-
      chons pas à décider pour les autres à ce sujet-là. C’est à chacun d’agir selon
      sa propre conscience.\r\nJusqu’ici, nous vous avons entretenus de choses sérieuses,
      parfois même tragiques. Nous avons traité de l’alcool dans ce qu’il a de pire.
      Mais nous ne sommes pas moroses pour autant. Si les nouveaux ne trouvaient aucune
      joie ou aucun plaisir dans notre exis- tence, ils n’en voudraient pas. Nous
      tenons absolument à profiter de la vie. Nous tâchons de ne pas donner dans le
      cynisme devant la situation mondiale, ni de porter sur nos épaules les péchés
      du monde. Lorsque nous voyons quelqu’un s’enliser dans le bourbier de l’alcoolisme,
      nous lui prodiguons les premiers soins et mettons nos ressources à sa disposition.
      Pour lui, nous racontons et nous revivons, pour ainsi dire, les horreurs de
      notre passé. Mais ceux d’entre nous qui ont tenté de prendre sur leurs épaules
      les ennuis des autres ont vite été dépassés par la situation.\r\nNous croyons
      donc que le rire et la gaieté peuvent être d’une grande utilité. Les gens de
      l’extérieur sont parfois scandalisés lorsque nous pouffons de rire au souvenir
      d’une expérience passée, en apparence tra- gique. Mais pourquoi nous priverions-nous
      de rire ? Nous sommes rétablis et nous avons été dotés du pou- voir d’aider
      les autres.\r\nTout le monde sait que les gens en mauvaise santé et ceux qui
      s’amusent rarement ne rient pas beaucoup. Laissons donc les membres de chaque
      famille s’amu- ser entre eux, ou séparément, autant que les circons- tances
      le permettent. Nous sommes certains que Dieu nous veut heureux, joyeux et libres.
      Nous ne pouvons souscrire à l’idée que la vie est une vallée de larmes, bien
      qu’elle l’ait déjà été pour un grand nombre d’entre nous. Mais il est évident
      que nous avons été la cause de notre propre misère. Ce n’est pas l’œuvre de
      Dieu. Évitons d’inventer le malheur à loisir et tirons profit des problèmes,
      lorsqu’ils surviennent, en nous réjouis- sant de l’occasion qui nous est donnée
      de démontrer Sa toute-puissance.\r\nParlons maintenant de la santé. Un corps
      auquel on a infligé les graves blessures de l’alcool ne se rétablit pas du jour
      au lendemain, pas plus que l’esprit défor- mé et la dépression ne disparaissent
      en un clin d’œil. Nous sommes convaincus qu’un mode de vie spirituel est le
      remède le plus puissant pour recouvrer la santé.\r\nPour nous qui nous sommes
      rétablis d’un grave pro- blème d’alcool, la santé mentale est un véritable miracle.
      Mais nous avons vu des changements tout aussi remarquables s’opérer dans nos
      corps. On aurait du mal à trouver parmi nous quelqu’un qui porte enco- re une
      quelconque marque de dégradation physique.\r\nCela ne signifie pas que nous
      ne tenons pas comp- te des moyens humains de guérison mis à notre dis- position.
      Dieu a généreusement pourvu ce monde de bons médecins, psychologues et spécialistes
      de toutes sortes. N’hésitez pas à confier vos problèmes de santé à ces professionnels.
      La plupart se dévoueront sans compter pour que leurs patients puissent jouir
      d’un esprit et d’un corps sains. Tâchez de vous rappeler que même si Dieu a
      accompli des miracles parmi nous, nous ne devons jamais sous-estimer un bon
      médecin ou un bon psychiatre. Leurs services sont souvent indis- pensables dans
      le traitement d’un nouveau et le suivi de ce traitement.\r\nUn des nombreux
      médecins qui ont eu l’occasion de lire ce livre dans sa forme manuscrite nous
      disait que manger des friandises pouvait souvent aider le patient, à condition
      bien sûr que le médecin donne son accord. Selon lui, tous les alcooliques devraient
      avoir du cho- colat à portée de la main en raison de son apport immé- diat d’énergie
      dans les moments de fatigue. Il ajoutait que les bonbons étaient recommandés
      pour calmer les occasionnelles fringales ressenties au cours de la nuit. Nous
      sommes nombreux à avoir constaté cette tendance à manger des sucreries et nous
      avons trouvé que cela nous aidait.\r\nUn mot sur les relations sexuelles. Pour
      certains hommes, l’alcool s’est révélé un tel stimulant sexuel qu’ils ont fait
      des abus. Des couples sont consternés en découvrant que l’alcoolique qui a cessé
      de boire donne maintenant des signes d’impuissance. À moins d’en comprendre
      la raison, il pourrait en découler un dérangement émotionnel. Certains parmi
      nous ont vécu cette expérience, mais pour profiter, après quelques mois, d’une
      intimité meilleure que jamais. On ne devrait pas hésiter à consulter un médecin
      ou un psy- chologue si la situation persiste. À notre connaissance, il existe
      peu de cas où le problème a duré longtemps.\r\nL’alcoolique aura peut-être du
      mal à rétablir des rela- tions amicales avec ses enfants. Du temps où il buvait,
      leurs jeunes esprits ont été impressionnés. Sans le dire, il se pourrait qu’ils
      détestent leur père cordialement pour ce qu’il leur a fait supporter, à eux
      et à leur mère. Les enfants sont souvent dominés par une dureté et un cynisme
      pathétiques. Ils se montrent incapables de par- donner et d’oublier. Cela peut
      durer des mois, long- temps après que leur mère a accepté le nouveau mode de
      vie et la nouvelle façon de penser de leur père.\r\nMais ils comprendront à
      la longue que leur père est un homme nouveau et à leur façon, ils le lui feront
      savoir. Et quand cela se produira, ils pourront être invi- tés à se joindre
      à la méditation du matin et à prendre ensuite part aux entretiens quotidiens
      sans rancœur ou parti pris. À partir de ce moment-là, le progrès sera rapide.
      Ces retrouvailles donnent souvent de mer- veilleux résultats.\r\nQue sa famille
      accepte ou non de vivre sur une base spirituelle, l’alcoolique, lui, doit le
      faire s’il veut se rétablir. Il faut que les autres puissent croire, sans l’ombre
      d’un doute, en sa nouvelle orientation. Pour la plupart des familles qui ont
      vécu avec un buveur, voir c’est croire.\r\nVoici un cas bien à propos. Un de
      nos amis est un fumeur et un buveur de café invétéré. Il ne fait aucun doute
      que sa consommation est abusive. Désireuse de lui rendre service, sa femme a
      commencé à lui repro- cher ces habitudes. Il a reconnu qu’il exagérait, mais
      a avoué franchement qu’il n’était pas prêt à les aban- donner. Sa femme, qui
      est de ceux qui trouvent quelque chose d’anormal à ces pratiques, s’est mise
      à le har- celer à tel point que son intolérance a fini par provo- quer un accès
      de colère chez son mari. Il s’est enivré.\r\nCertes, notre ami avait tort, tout
      à fait tort. À grand- peine, il a du l’admettre et réviser ensuite ses principes
      spirituels. Bien que ce soit maintenant un membre très actif des Alcooliques
      anonymes, il fume encore et boit toujours autant de café ; cependant, ni sa
      femme ni personne ne le jugent. Cette dernière se rend compte qu’elle avait
      eu tort de monter cette situation en épingle alors que son mari se remettait
      rapidement de maux bien plus graves.\r\nNous vous proposons trois courts slogans
      qui nous semblent à propos. Les voici :\r\nL’important d’abord. Vivre et laisser
      vivre. Agir... aisément.\r\n"

    - AUX EMPLOYEURS
    - "Parmi les nombreux employeurs que nous connaissons, nous pensons à un de nos
      membres qui a passé une grande partie de sa vie dans le monde des grandes entreprises.
      Il a embauché et congédié des centaines d’hommes. C’est avec un œil d’employeur
      qu’il voit l’alcoolique. Son point de vue actuel devrait se révéler exceptionnellement
      utile aux gens d’affaires, où qu’ils soient. Mais laissons-le parler.\r\nJ’
      ai déjà été directeur adjoint d’ un service qui employait six cents personnes.
      Un jour, ma secrétaire m’a annoncé que M.B. insistait pour me parler. Je lui
      ai dit de répondre que je n’étais pas intéressé. J’avais prévenu plusieurs fois
      cet employé qu’il ne lui restait plus qu’une seule chance. Peu de temps après,
      il m’avait téléphoné de Hartford, deux jours de suite, dans un état d’ébriété
      tel qu’il pouvait à peine parler. J’ai dit à ma secrétaire que c’en était fini
      de lui, bel et bien fini.\r\nMa secrétaire est revenue me dire que ce n’était
      pas M.B. au téléphone mais son frère, et que celui-ci avait un message pour
      moi. Je m’attendais encore à une demande d’indulgence, mais voici ce que j’ai
      entendu au bout du fil : « Je voulais seulement vous dire que Paul s’est jeté
      du haut d’une fenêtre d’un hôtel à Hart- ford samedi dernier. Il a laissé une
      note disant que vous étiez le meilleur patron qu’il avait jamais eu et que vous
      n’étiez responsable en aucune façon de son geste. »\r\nUne autre fois, comme
      j’ouvrais une lettre posée sur mon bureau, une coupure de journal est tombée.
      Il s’agissait de la nécrologie de l’un des meilleurs repré- sentants que j’avais
      eus dans mon service. Après deux semaines de beuverie, il avait appuyé sur la
      gâchette d’un fusil après avoir mis le bout du canon dans sa bouche. Six semaines
      auparavant, je l’avais congédié pour cause d’alcoolisme.\r\nVoici encore un
      autre exemple : une femme, par- lant faiblement dans l’appareil, m’a téléphoné
      de Vir- ginie. Elle voulait savoir si l’assurance contractée par son mari avec
      l’entreprise était encore en vigueur. Quatre jours auparavant, il s’était pendu
      dans la remi- se à bois. Parce qu’il buvait, j’avais dû le congédier en dépit
      de son intelligence et de son esprit vif ; il était l’un des meilleurs organisateurs
      que j’avais connus.\r\nVoilà donc trois hommes exceptionnels à jamais per- dus
      parce que, à ce moment-là, je ne comprenais pas l’alcoolisme comme je le comprends
      aujourd’hui. Et, ironie du sort, je suis moi-même devenu alcoolique ! Sans l’intervention
      d’une personne qui m’a compris, j’aurais peut-être suivi leur chemin. Ma chute
      a coûté on ne sait combien de milliers de dollars au monde des affaires car
      il faut beaucoup d’argent pour former un homme à un poste de haute direction.
      Ce genre de gas- pillage ne se rattrape jamais. Selon nous, le monde des affaires
      est touché par une situation qui pourrait être améliorée si elle était mieux
      comprise un peu partout.\r\nPresque tous les employeurs de nos jours se sen-
      tent moralement responsables du bien-être de leurs employés et tentent de s’acquitter
      de cette responsa- bilité. Qu’ils ne l’aient pas toujours fait en face des alcooliques
      est facile à comprendre. Aux yeux de l’employeur, l’alcoolique a souvent fait
      figure de fou de la pire espèce. Parfois, en raison du talent parti- culier
      de l’employé ou du grand attachement person- nel de l’employeur envers l’employé,
      ce dernier a été maintenu à son poste et cela, plus longtemps qu’il ne convenait.
      Certains employeurs ont essayé tous les remèdes connus. Quelques-uns seulement
      ont manqué de patience et de tolérance. Et nous, qui avons abusé des meilleurs
      employeurs, pouvons difficilement leur reprocher de nous avoir brusqués.\r\nEn
      voici un exemple typique. Un des membres de l’une des institutions bancaires
      les plus importantes en Amérique sait que je ne bois plus. Un jour, il m’a parlé
      d’un des membres du conseil de cette banque et d’après le portrait qu’il en
      faisait, cet homme était sans doute alcoolique. J’ai vu là une occasion de rendre
      service. Alors, pendant deux heures, je lui ai parlé de cette maladie qu’est
      l’alcoolisme et j’ai décrit les symptômes et les conséquences du mieux que j’ai
      pu. Il a fait le commentaire suivant : « Très intéressant. Mais je suis certain
      que cet homme a réglé son problème d’alcool. Il est revenu récemment d’un congé
      de trois mois, il a suivi une cure de désintoxication, il a l’air de bien se
      porter et, par surcroît, le conseil l’a averti que c’était sa dernière chance.
      »\r\nJe pouvais seulement lui répondre que si les choses se passaient comme
      d’habitude, cet homme rechuterait plus durement que jamais. Cela, pensais-je,
      était inévi- table, et je me demandais si la banque n’agissait pas de façon
      injuste envers lui. Pourquoi ne pas le mettre en contact avec un alcoolique
      membre d’un de nos groupes ? Il aurait peut-être une chance de s’en sortir.
      Je lui ai signalé que je n’avais pas avalé une goutte d’alcool depuis trois
      ans et cela, malgré des difficultés qui auraient poussé neuf hommes sur dix
      à se soûler comme des perdus. Pourquoi ne pas lui donner l’occasion d’en- tendre
      mon histoire ? « Oh ! non ! répondit mon ami. Ou bien ce type cesse de boire,
      ou bien il se retrouvera sans emploi. S’il a autant de volonté et de courage
      que toi,ilvaréussirets’ensortir. »\r\nJ’aurais voulu crier mon découragement,
      car je voyais que je n’avais pas réussi à amener mon ami banquier à comprendre.
      Il ne pouvait tout simplement pas croire que son confrère du conseil souffrait
      d’une maladie grave. Je n’avais qu’à attendre.\r\nL’homme en question a effectivement
      rechuté et perdu son emploi. Nous sommes entrés en contact avec lui après son
      licenciement. Sans difficulté, il a accep- té les principes et la méthode qui
      nous avaient aidés. Je ne doute pas qu’il soit en voie de rétablissement. Pour
      moi, cet incident illustre l’incompréhension que l’on a de la souffrance de
      l’alcoolique et l’ignorance des employeurs quant au rôle qu’ils pourraient jouer
      dans le rétablissement de leurs employés atteints de la maladie.\r\nSi vous
      désirez venir en aide à un alcoolique, vous feriez bien de ne pas tenir compte
      de votre façon de boire, ou de ne pas boire. Que vous soyez un buveur invétéré
      ou modéré, ou que vous ne buviez pas du tout, vous pouvez avoir des opinions
      bien arrêtées ou même des préjugés sur la question. Si vous buvez modéré- ment
      vous êtes peut-être plus ennuyé par les alcoo- liques que celui qui est parfaitement
      abstinent. Le fait de boire occasionnellement et de comprendre vos propres réactions
      vous procure une assurance envers nombre de choses qui ne se vérifient pas nécessaire-
      ment chez les alcooliques. En tant que buveur modé- ré, vous pouvez, à volonté,
      boire ou ne pas boire. Vous pouvez vous maîtriser comme vous le voulez. Lors-
      qu’il vous arrive un soir de faire la fête, vous pouvez vous lever le lendemain,
      secouer la tête et vaquer à vos affaires. Pour vous, l’alcool n’est pas vraiment
      un problème. Vous ne pouvez pas comprendre pourquoi il en serait un pour d’autres,
      sinon pour les gens sans volonté ou idiots.\r\nLorsqu’on a affaire à un alcoolique,
      il peut arriver – et cela est naturel – que l’on soit agacé par sa faiblesse,
      sa bêtise et son irresponsabilité. Même ceux qui com- prennent mieux la maladie
      risquent encore de réagir de la sorte.\r\nRegarder agir un alcoolique dans votre
      société sou- vent vous éclairera. Habituellement, cet alcoolique n’est-il pas
      brillant, vif d’esprit, plein d’imagination et sympathique ? Lorsqu’il n’a pas
      bu, est-ce qu’il ne tra- vaille pas beaucoup et n’a-t-il pas le don de faire
      avancer les choses ? S’il avait ces qualités et qu’il ne buvait pas, vaudrait-illapeinedelegarderdansvotreservice
      ?A-t- il droit à la même considération que les autres employés en mauvaise santé
      ? Vaut-il la peine d’être sauvé ? Si vous croyez que oui, alors les suggestions
      ci-dessous peuvent vous être utiles, que vous agissiez pour des rai- sons humanitaires
      ou d’affaires, ou les deux.\r\nPouvez-vous mettre de côté l’impression que vous
      êtes en face d’un simple cas de mauvaise habitude, d’en- têtement ou de manque
      de volonté ? Si cela vous pose des difficultés, vous auriez avantage à relire
      les chapitres deux et trois, où la maladie de l’alcoolisme est longue- ment
      expliquée. À titre d’homme d’affaires, vous voulez être certain de la nécessité
      d’agir avant d’envisager les résultats. Si vous admettez que votre employé est
      malade, pouvez-vous lui pardonner ce qu’il a fait dans le passé ? Pouvez-vous
      oublier les absurdités passées ?\r\nEst-il possible que vous teniez compte du
      fait qu’il a été victime d’une façon de penser aberrante directement causée
      par l’action de l’alcool sur son cerveau ?\r\nJe me souviens très bien de ma
      surprise en enten- dant un éminent médecin de Chicago me rapporter des cas de
      patients dont la pression du liquide rachidien avait effectivement causé des
      lésions au cerveau. Com- ment s’étonner qu’un alcoolique soit irrationnel !
      Qui ne le serait pas avec un cerveau enfiévré à ce point ? Les buveurs normaux
      ne sont pas autant affectés et ne peuvent pas non plus comprendre les aberrations
      des alcooliques.\r\nVotre employé a probablement essayé de cacher nombre de
      ses histoires gênantes, certaines peut-être très sérieuses. Elles peuvent être
      répugnantes. Vous pourriez vous y perdre à essayer de comprendre com- ment un
      individu aussi loyal en apparence a pu agir de la sorte. Mais ses bévues, si
      graves soient-elles, peu- vent généralement être imputées à l’action anormale
      de l’alcool sur son esprit. Lorsqu’il boit ou se relève d’une cuite, un alcoolique
      qui est un modèle d’honnêteté peut faire des choses incroyables. Après coup,
      il en est ter- riblement dégoûté. Ces bêtises sont presque toujours le fait
      de situations passagères.\r\nIl ne s’agit pas ici de croire que tous les alcooliques
      sont honnêtes et se comportent correctement lorsqu’ils ne boivent pas. C’est
      faux, bien sûr, et ils peuvent sou- vent abuser de votre confiance. Voyant que
      vous essayez de les comprendre et de les aider, certains alcooliques tenteront
      de profiter de votre bonté. Si vous êtes certain que votre employé n’a pas l’intention
      de cesser de boire, il vaut peut-être mieux le congédier et le plus tôt sera
      le mieux. Vous ne lui rendez pas ser- vice en le gardant. Congédier cet individu
      pourrait s’avérer un bienfait pour lui. Cela pourrait être juste le choc dont
      il a besoin. Personnellement, je sais que mon entreprise n’aurait rien pu faire
      pour me pousser à ces- ser de boire car, tant que j’ai pu garder mon emploi,
      je ne pouvais pas me rendre compte à quel point ma situation était grave. Si,
      après m’avoir congédié, on avait entrepris de me mettre au courant de la solution
      contenue dans ce livre, je serais peut-être retourné dans l’entreprise six mois
      plus tard, rétabli.\r\nMais beaucoup d’hommes veulent arrêter de boire et vous
      pourrez aller loin avec eux. La compréhension dont vous pourriez faire preuve
      dans le traitement de ces cas pourrait vous rapporter.\r\nPeut-être avez-vous
      à l’esprit un homme de ce genre. Il désire cesser de boire et vous voulez l’aider,
      ne serait- ce que dans l’intérêt de votre entreprise. Maintenant, vous en savez
      plus long sur l’alcoolisme. Vous êtes en mesure de voir qu’il est malade mentalement
      et phy- siquement. Vous êtes prêt à oublier ses erreurs passées. Supposons que
      vous décidiez de l’aborder de la façon suivante :\r\nVous lui dites que vous
      êtes au courant de sa consommation d’alcool et que cela doit cesser. Vous pouvez
      mentionner que vous reconnaissez son talent, que vous aimeriez le garder comme
      employé, mais que vous ne pourrez pas s’il continue de boire. Une attitu- de
      ferme à ce stade-ci a aidé beaucoup d’entre nous.\r\nEnsuite, vous ajoutez que
      vous n’avez pas l’inten- tion de lui tenir un discours ni de lui faire la morale
      et que vous ne le condamnerez pas ; que si cela s’est produit dans le passé,
      c’était en raison d’un manque de compréhension de votre part. Si c’est possible,
      ne montrez aucune rancune envers lui. Ce pourrait être le moment de lui expliquer
      la maladie de l’alcoolisme.\r\nDites-lui que vous le considérez comme une personne
      gravement malade, qu’il peut même en mourir, et demandez-lui s’il désire se
      rétablir. Vous lui deman- dez parce que de nombreux alcooliques qui sont intoxi-
      qués et qui ont l’esprit faussé ne veulent pas renoncer à l’alcool. Mais lui,
      veut-il cesser de boire ? Prendra- t-il toutes les mesures nécessaires pour
      y parvenir, est- il prêt à tout pour se rétablir, pour cesser de boire à jamais
      ?\r\nS’il dit oui, alors continuez : est-il vraiment décidé ou, en son for intérieur,
      croit-il pouvoir vous leurrer en se proposant de prendre un verre de temps en
      temps après s’être reposé et avoir subi un traitement ? Selon nous, il importe
      de sonder le sujet profondément sur ces points. Assurez-vous qu’il n’essaie
      pas de vous tromper ni de se tromper lui-même.\r\nNous laissons à votre discrétion
      le choix de men- tionner ou non ce livre. Si l’employé hésite et croit encore
      pouvoir continuer de boire, même si ce n’est que de la bière, il vaudrait mieux
      le congédier la pro- chaine fois qu’il fera la fête, ce qui ne manquera pas
      d’arriver s’il est alcoolique. Il doit absolument com- prendre cet état de fait.
      Ou bien l’homme que vous avez devant vous veut et peut se rétablir, ou bien
      il ne veut pas ni ne peut. Dans ce dernier cas, ne perdez pas de temps avec
      lui. Ce conseil peut sembler dur, mais c’est généralement la meilleure façon
      d’agir.\r\nAprès vous être assuré que votre employé désire vraiment se rétablir
      et est prêt à tout pour y parvenir, vous pouvez lui proposer une ligne de conduite
      préci- se. Pour la plupart des alcooliques qui boivent encore ou qui se remettent
      d’une cuite, un traitement physique est indiqué, même impératif. Cette question
      du traite- ment devrait, bien sûr, être mise entre les mains de votre propre
      médecin. Quelle que soit la méthode, le but est de débarrasser l’esprit et le
      corps de l’alcoo- lique des effets de l’alcool. Cette désintoxication prend
      rarement beaucoup de temps et ne coûte pas trop cher lorsqu’elle est menée par
      des gens compétents. Votre homme se rétablira plus vite s’il se trouve dans
      une condition physique lui permettant de penser vraiment et de ne plus être
      obsédé par l’alcool. Si vous lui pro- posez cette méthode, il est possible que
      vous ayez à lui avancer le montant du traitement. Il est cependant important
      qu’il comprenne bien que toute dépense sera ultérieurement déduite de son salaire.
      Il vaut mieux que votre employé se sente entièrement responsable de son rétablissement.\r\nS’il
      accepte votre offre, vous devrez lui faire remar- quer que le traitement physique
      représente seulement une partie du programme de rétablissement. Même si vous
      lui procurez les meilleurs soins médicaux pos- sibles, il doit comprendre qu’un
      changement intérieur doit également se produire en lui. S’il veut surmonter
      son problème d’alcool, il devra modifier son attitude ainsi que sa façon de
      penser. Chacun de nous a dû placer son rétablissement avant toute chose car,
      si nous ne nous étions pas rétablis, nous aurions perdu foyer et travail.\r\nPouvez-vous
      avoir entièrement confiance en sa capa- cité de se rétablir ? Et puisqu’il est
      question de confian- ce, pouvez-vous lui donner l’assurance que dans la mesure
      où vous êtes concerné, cette affaire est tout à fait personnelle et que ses
      bévues comme alcoolique ainsi que le traitement auquel il se soumettra ne seront
      jamais abordés sans son consentement ? Il serait indi- qué que vous ayez un
      long entretien avec lui après son traitement.\r\nRevenons-en au sujet de ce
      livre. Il renferme des suggestions concrètes s’adressant à l’employé désireux
      de régler son problème d’alcool. Quelques-unes des idées qu’il contient sont
      nouvelles pour vous. Peut-être n’êtes-vous pas très attiré par l’approche que
      nous pro- posons. Loin de nous l’intention de l’offrir comme le fin du fin.
      Cependant, en ce qui nous concerne, cette méthode a été efficace. Après tout,
      les résultats ne sont- ils pas plus importants que les moyens de les atteindre
      ? Que cela lui plaise ou non, votre employé découvri- ra la triste vérité sur
      l’alcoolisme. Même s’il n’est pas convaincu de l’utilité du remède, celui-ci
      ne pourra pas lui faire de tort.\r\nNous vous suggérons de mentionner ce livre
      au méde- cin qui s’occupera de votre protégé pendant le traite- ment. S’il le
      patient le lit dans un moment de profonde dépression, dès qu’il se trouve de
      nouveau en état de lire, il pourrait prendre conscience de sa condition.\r\nIl
      est à espérer que le médecin révélera au patient la vérité sur son état, quel
      qu’il puisse être. Au moment de donner le livre au patient, il vaut mieux ne
      pas lui dire qu’il doit se conformer aux suggestions présentées au fil des pages.
      La décision doit venir de lui.\r\nVous êtes bien sûr prêt à parier que votre
      change- ment d’attitude et le contenu de ce livre régleront le problème. Dans
      certains cas oui, dans d’autres non. Mais, selon nous, si vous persévérez, vous
      serez récom- pensé par le taux de réussite. Notre œuvre prenant de l’ampleur
      et notre nombre augmentant, nous espérons que vos employés pourront être mis
      en contact avec certains d’entre nous. D’ici là, nous sommes certains qu’un
      bon bout de chemin peut être franchi par la seule mise en pratique des conseils
      de ce livre.\r\nLorsque votre employé reviendra de sa cure, entre- tenez-vous
      avec lui. Demandez-lui s’il croit avoir la solution. S’il se sent libre de discuter
      de son problè- me avec vous, s’il sait que vous le comprenez et que vous ne
      serez pas outré par ce qu’il désire vous dire, il est probable qu’il se mettra
      vite à la tâche.\r\nAu fait, croyez-vous pouvoir entendre sans broncher les
      révélations bouleversantes que votre employé s’ap- prête à vous faire ? Il pourrait,
      par exemple, dévoiler qu’il a déjà gonflé ses notes de frais ou qu’il projetait
      de s’approprier vos meilleurs clients. En réalité, s’il a accepté notre solution
      qui, comme vous le savez, exige une rigoureuse honnêteté, il pourrait vous dire
      à peu près n’importe quoi. Êtes-vous prêt à faire une croix sur ses agissements
      passés comme vous le feriez sur le dossier d’un mauvais client, et à recommencer
      à zéro avec lui ? S’il vous doit de l’argent, vous pourriez lui proposer un
      arrangement.\r\nS’il vous parle de sa situation familiale, vous pou- vez sans
      doute lui faire des suggestions utiles. Peut-il s’entretenir franchement avec
      vous s’il s’abstient de par- ler de secrets d’affaires ou de critiquer ses confrères
      ? S’il peut vous faire confiance, tout employé dans cette situation sera envers
      vous d’une loyauté indéfectible.\r\nNos plus grands ennemis, à nous alcooliques,
      sont le ressentiment, la jalousie, l’envie, la frustration et la peur. Partout
      où les affaires réunissent des hommes, il y a de la rivalité, et de cette rivalité
      naissent certaines intrigues de bureau. Nous avons parfois l’impression que
      les gens tentent de nous déprécier. Souvent il n’en est rien du tout. Mais il
      peut arriver que notre alcoo- lisme serve de « capital politique » à d’autres.\r\nIl
      nous vient à l’esprit le cas d’un individu mali- cieux qui faisait constamment
      des petites blagues amu- santes sur les exploits de buveur d’un collègue alcoolique.
      C’était une façon sournoise de faire des commérages. Un autre cas est celui
      d’un alcoolique qui a été hospitalisé pour y subir un traitement. Au début,
      seulement quelques-uns l’ont su mais en peu de temps, la nouvelle s’est répandue
      dans toute l’entreprise. Natu- rellement, dans un tel contexte, l’employé avait
      moins de chances de se rétablir. Souvent l’employeur peut protéger la victime
      contre ce genre de racontars. Il ne peut lui accorder davantage sa faveur, mais
      il est tou- jours possible d’empêcher quelqu’un d’être l’objet de provocation
      inutile ou de critique injuste.\r\nComme groupe, les alcooliques sont des gens
      éner- giques. Ils travaillent dur et s’amusent ferme. Votre employé est sans
      doute prêt à déployer toute son ardeur à la tâche. Étant quelque peu affaibli
      et devant se réhabi- tuer physiquement et mentalement à une vie dont l’al- cool
      est exclu, il pourrait forcer la note. Vous pourriez être amené à freiner son
      désir de travailler seize heures par jour. Il sera peut-être nécessaire de l’encourager
      à s’amuser de temps en temps. Il désirera peut-être se dévouer auprès d’autres
      alcooliques, et cela pourrait se produire pendant ses heures de travail. Dans
      ce cas, une certaine latitude serait utile. Pour demeurer abstinent, cet homme
      a besoin de ce genre d’occupation.\r\nUne fois que votre homme aura passé plusieurs
      mois sans boire, vous pourrez utiliser ses services auprès d’autres employés
      alcooliques qui vous donnent du fil à retordre, à condition, bien sûr, que ces
      derniers consen- tent à ce qu’une tierce personne entre en scène. Un alcoolique
      rétabli, mais dont le poste est relativement peu important, est en mesure de
      parler à un autre dont le poste est plus élevé. Vivant sur une base totalement
      dif- férente, jamais il ne prendra avantage de la situation.\r\nVous pouvez
      faire confiance à votre homme. Certes, une longue expérience des excuses des
      alcooliques éveille naturellement le doute. La prochaine fois que sa femme téléphonera
      pour dire qu’il est malade, vous pourriez immédiatement conclure qu’il est ivre.
      Si c’est le cas et qu’il est encore désireux de se rétablir, il va tout vous
      raconter même si cela peut entraîner la perte de son emploi. Car il sait qu’il
      doit être honnête s’il veut seulement rester en vie. Il appréciera le fait que
      vous ne vous cassez pas la tête à son sujet, que vous ne le soupçonnez pas,
      que vous ne tentez pas non plus de le tenir le plus possible à l’abri de la
      tentation de boire. S’il suit consciencieusement le programme de rétablissement,
      il peut aller partout où vos affaires pour- raient l’appeler.\r\nS’il a une
      rechute, ne serait-ce qu’une fois, vous devrez décider si oui ou non vous allez
      le congédier. Si vous êtes certain qu’il n’est pas sérieux, vous devriez sans
      aucun doute le renvoyer. Si, au contraire, vous êtes sûr qu’il fait tout son
      possible pour s’en sortir, peut-être désirerez-vous lui donner une autre chance.
      Cependant vous ne devez pas vous sentir obligé de le garder car vous avez déjà
      bien fait votre devoir.\r\nIl y a autre chose que vous pourriez avoir envie
      de faire. Si vous êtes dans une grande société, vous pour- riez passer ce livre
      aux jeunes cadres. Vous feriez bien de leur laisser savoir que vous n’êtes pas
      en mauvais termes avec les alcooliques de votre entreprise. Ces cadres sont
      souvent dans une position difficile. Il arri- ve fréquemment que les hommes
      sous leurs ordres soient leurs amis. Alors, pour une raison ou pour une autre,
      ils protègent leurs subordonnés, espérant que les choses vont s’arranger. Souvent,
      ils mettent leur propre poste en péril en essayant de venir en aide à des buveurs
      qui auraient dû être remerciés depuis longtemps ou aux- quels on aurait dû fournir
      l’occasion de se rétablir.\r\nAprès avoir lu ce livre, le jeune cadre peut aborder
      un employé et lui dire à peu près cela : « Écoute bien, Ed. Veux-tu, oui ou
      non, cesser de boire ? Tu me mets sur la sellette chaque fois que tu t’enivres.
      C’est injus- te envers moi et envers la compagnie. J’ai appris des choses au
      sujet de l’alcoolisme. Si tu es alcoolique, tu es un homme gravement malade.
      D’ailleurs, tu te conduis comme tel. La compagnie désire t’aider à te rétablir
      et, si la chose t’intéresse, il y a une façon de t’en sortir. Si tu acceptes
      cette méthode, ton passé sera oublié et le fait de t’absenter pour te faire
      soigner ne sera pas mentionné. Mais si tu ne peux pas et ne veux pas cesser
      de boire, je crois qu’il vaut mieux que tu démissionnes. »\r\nLe jeune directeur
      en question peut ne pas être d’accord avec le contenu de notre livre. Il n’est
      pas nécessaire, ni indiqué bien souvent, qu’il le montre à l’employé. Mais au
      moins, il comprendra le problème et ne se laissera plus leurrer par les promesses
      habi- tuelles. Il sera en mesure de prendre envers cet homme une position éminemment
      claire et juste. Il n’aura plus de raisons de couvrir un employé alcoo- lique.\r\nCela
      revient à dire qu’aucun employé ne devrait être congédié simplement parce qu’il
      est alcoolique. S’il veut cesser de boire, on devrait réellement lui donner
      l’occasion de le faire. S’il ne peut ou ne veut pas renon- cer à l’alcool, il
      devrait être licencié. Les exceptions à cette règle sont rares.\r\nSelon nous,
      la démarche proposée permettra de réa- liser plusieurs choses. Elle donnera
      à des hommes de valeur la chance de se rétablir. En même temps, elle vous permettra
      de n’avoir aucune hésitation à vous libérer de ceux qui ne peuvent ou ne veulent
      pas cesser de boire. Peut-être l’alcoolisme cause-t-il de graves dommages à
      votre entreprise par les pertes de temps, d’effectifs et de réputation qu’il
      entraîne. Nous espérons que nos suggestions vous aideront à remé- dier à cet
      état de fait. Nous croyons faire preuve de bon sens lorsque nous insistons pour
      que vous met- tiez fin à ce gaspillage et que vous donniez une chance à l’employé
      qui en vaut la peine.\r\nL’autre jour, nous sommes allés rencontrer le vice-
      président d’une grande société industrielle. Voici ce qu’il nous a dit : « Je
      suis très heureux pour vous que vous ayez réussi à surmonter votre problème
      d’alcool. Mais la politique de notre entreprise est de ne pas inter- venir dans
      la vie privée des salariés. Si un homme boit trop et que son travail en souffre,
      nous le congédions. Je ne vois pas de quelle façon vous pourriez nous aider
      car, comme vous voyez, nous n’avons aucun problè- me d’alcool ». Cette même
      société consacre chaque année des millions à la recherche. Ses coûts de pro-
      duction sont calculés à la décimale près. Le personnel dispose d’ installations
      récréatives. Il bénéficie de régimes d’assurance. L’entreprise se soucie réellement
      du bien-être de ses employés tant pour des raisons humanitaires que dans son
      propre intérêt. Mais l’al- coolisme, non, elle ne croit tout simplement pas
      qu’il existe dans ses murs.\r\nPeut-être s’agit-il d’une attitude typique. Nous
      qui, comme groupe, avons une bonne connaissance du monde des affaires, du moins
      du point de vue de l’al- coolisme, nous n’avons pu faire autrement que de sou-
      rire en entendant l’opinion sincère de cet homme bien pensant. Il serait probablement
      renversé de savoir com- bien l’alcoolisme coûte à son entreprise chaque année.
      Cette société compte sans doute plusieurs alcooliques actifs ou en puissance.
      D’après nous, les cadres des grandes sociétés n’ont souvent qu’une idée très
      vague de l’ampleur du problème chez eux. Même si vous avez l’impression que
      le problème n’existe pas chez vous, vous auriez avantage à y regarder de plus
      près. Peut- être ferez-vous des découvertes intéressantes.\r\nCe chapitre porte,
      bien sûr, sur les alcooliques, les gens malades, les hommes dérangés. Les alcooliques
      que notre ami le vice-président avait à l’esprit étaient les buveurs normaux
      ou les fêtards. Pour ceux-là, sa politique était sans aucun doute sensée, mais
      il ne fai- sait pas la distinction entre ce genre de buveurs et les alcooliques.\r\nIl
      ne faudrait pas croire qu’on doit consacrer à l’em- ployé alcoolique trop de
      temps ou d’attention. Il ne doit pas jouir d’un traitement de faveur. Le vrai
      bon sujet, celui qui se rétablit, refusera ce genre de solli- citude. Il n’abusera
      pas. Loin de là. Il travaillera d’ar- rache-pied et vous sera reconnaissant
      jusqu’à la fin de ses jours.\r\nAujourd’hui, je suis propriétaire d’une petite
      entre- prise. Parmi mes employés, il y a deux alcooliques dont le rendement
      au travail équivaut à celui de cinq repré- sentants normaux. Et pourquoi pas
      ? Ils ont adopté une attitude nouvelle, ils ont échappé à une condition de morts
      vivants. J’ai vraiment savouré tous les instants que j’ai consacrés à les remettre
      d’aplomb.\r\n."

    - LA VIE QUI VOUS ATTEND
    - "Pour la plupart des gens normaux, boire est synonyme de convivialité, de camaraderie
      et de rêves heureux et colorés. Prendre un verre libère de l’ennui et des tracas.
      C’est l’intimité joyeuse avec des amis et la sensation que la vie est belle.
      Mais il n’en fut pas ainsi dans les derniers jours de notre consom- mation exagérée.
      Les plaisirs d’hier s’étaient enfuis. Ils n’étaient plus que souvenirs. Jamais
      plus n’avons-nous pu revivre les moments de joie intense du passé. Nous étions
      habités par un désir pressant de goûter la vie comme auparavant et obsédés par
      la pensée que, par miracle, nous pourrions retrouver la maîtrise de nous- mêmes
      et combler ce désir. Mais chaque nouvelle ten- tative était un échec.\r\nMoins
      les gens nous toléraient, plus nous nous reti- rions de la société, de la vie
      elle-même. À mesure que nous devenions assujettis à Sa Majesté l’alcool, citoyens
      tremblants de son royaume dément, le brouillard glacial de la solitude s’abattait
      sur nous, de plus en plus épais, de plus en plus sombre. Certains parmi nous
      recher- chaient les endroits sordides, espérant y trouver la com- pagnie de
      gens sympathiques et compréhensifs. Cela durait un temps, puis nous retombions
      dans l’isolement et devions, dans un affreux retour à la réalité, faire face
      aux quatre monstres que sont la Terreur, la Confusion, la Frustration et le
      Désespoir. Les buveurs malheureux qui lisent ces lignes comprendront !\r\nDans
      un de ses quelques moments d’abstinence, un gros buveur dira : « L’alcool ne
      me manque pas du tout. Je me sens mieux ; je travaille mieux ; je m’amu- se
      davantage. » À titre d’anciens buveurs à problèmes, nous sourions en entendant
      cette déclaration. Nous savons que notre ami est comme le petit garçon qui siffle
      dans le noir pour se donner du courage. Il se leurre. Intérieurement, il donnerait
      n’importe quoi pour être capable de boire une demi-douzaine de verres et s’en
      tirer indemne. Il s’essaiera bientôt encore à son vieux jeu car il n’est pas
      heureux dans son abstinen- ce. Il ne peut imaginer la vie sans alcool. Un jour
      vien- dra où il sera incapable d’imaginer la vie ni avec, ni sans l’alcool.
      Alors il connaîtra la solitude comme bien peu de gens la connaissent. Il se
      trouvera au bord du gouffre. Il souhaitera en finir avec la vie.\r\nNous avons
      montré comment nous avons repris le dessus. Sans doute pensez-vous : « Oui,
      je veux bien. Mais est-ce que je devrai me résigner à mener une vie où j’aurai
      le même air stupide, ennuyeux et triste que je vois à certaines personnes vertueuses
      ? Je sais que je dois me passer d’alcool, mais comment faire ? Avez- vous quelque
      chose de satisfaisant à me proposer en échange ? »\r\nOui, et même plus que
      cela encore : c’est le mou- vement des Alcooliques anonymes. Vous y serez sou-
      lagé de votre ennui, de vos tracas et de vos soucis. Votre imagination y sera
      grandement stimulée. Enfin, vous trouverez un sens à la vie. Les années les
      plus heureuses de votre existence sont encore à venir. C’est ce que nous avons
      trouvé dans notre association et il en sera de même pour vous.\r\n« De quelle
      manière cela va-t-il arriver ? deman- dez-vous. Où vais-je trouver ces gens-là
      ? »\r\nVous vous ferez ces nouveaux amis dans votre propre milieu. Tout près
      de vous, il y a des alcooliques qui se meurent, sans secours, comme les naufragés
      d’un navire en détresse. Si vous demeurez dans un grand centre, vous en trouverez
      des centaines. Riches ou pauvres, de classe sociale élevée ou inférieure, ce
      sont de futurs membres des Alcooliques anonymes. Parmi eux, certains deviendront
      vos amis pour la vie. Il se créera entre vous des liens nouveaux et merveilleux
      car ensemble, vous échapperez au désastre et, côte à côte, vous entreprendrez
      le même voyage. Alors vous com- prendrez ce que signifie le don de soi, celui
      par lequel d’autres peuvent échapper à la mort et redécouvrir la vie. Vous apprendrez
      la pleine signification de : « Aime ton prochain comme toi-même. »\r\nIl peut
      sembler incroyable que ces hommes puissent redevenir heureux, respectés et utiles.
      Comment peu- vent-ils se sortir d’une telle misère, d’un tel déshon- neur et
      d’une situation aussi désespérée ? La réponse logique à cette question est que
      puisque de telles choses se sont produites pour nous, elles peuvent aussi vous
      arriver. Si vous désirez ce changement par-dessus tout et que vous êtes disposé
      à profiter de notre expérien- ce, nous sommes convaincus qu’il s’effectuera.
      L’époque des miracles n’est pas révolue. Notre réta- blissement en est la preuve
      !\r\nNous espérons que lorsque ce livre sans prétention sera lancé contre la
      marée mondiale de l’alcoolisme, les buveurs désespérés s’y accrocheront et qu’ils
      en suivront les suggestions. Plusieurs, nous en sommes certains, se relèveront
      et reprendront la route. À leur tour, ils entreront en contact avec d’autres
      malades, et peut-être verrons-nous surgir dans chaque ville et dans chaque village
      des associations des Alcooliques anonymes, véritables havres pour ceux qui doivent
      trou- ver le moyen de s’en sortir.\r\nDans le chapitre intitulé Au secours des
      autres, vous avez pu vous faire une idée de notre façon d’appro- cher les autres
      et de les aider à retrouver la santé. Sup- posons maintenant que, grâce à vous,
      plusieurs familles aient adopté notre mode de vie. Vous voudrez savoir comment
      procéder à partir de ce moment-là. La meilleure façon de vous donner un aperçu
      de ce qui vous attend est peut-être de vous décrire comment l’as- sociation
      a grandi. Voici en quelques mots comment cela s’est passé :\r\nIl y a plusieurs
      années, en 1935, un de nos membres s’était rendu dans une ville de l’ouest du
      pays. Sur le plan commercial, son voyage s’est soldé par un échec. S’il avait
      réussi sa démarche, il aurait été lancé finan- cièrement, ce qui à cette époque
      était d’une importan- ce capitale pour lui. Mais l’entreprise s’est terminée
      par une poursuite judiciaire ; elle a complètement échoué. Les démêlés reliés
      à l’affaire ont été marqués par beaucoup de rancune et de controverse.\r\nProfondément
      découragé, il se retrouvait dans une ville étrangère, discrédité et presque
      sans argent. Enco- re physiquement faible et abstinent depuis quelques mois
      seulement, il a compris le danger de sa situation. Il ressentait un urgent besoin
      de parler avec quelqu’un. Mais avec qui ?\r\nL’après-midi était sombre ; il
      faisait les cent pas dans le hall d’un hôtel, se demandant avec quel argent
      il allait payer sa note. À une extrémité du hall se trou- vait, sous verre,
      un répertoire des églises locales. À l’autre bout de la pièce, une porte donnait
      sur un bar plutôt attirant. Il pouvait y voir une foule animée et joyeuse. Parmi
      ces gens, il trouverait sans doute des amis et du réconfort. Cependant, à moins
      de prendre quelques verres, il n’aurait pas le courage de lier connaissance
      avec quelqu’un, et il serait seul pendant tout le week-end.\r\nBien sûr il ne
      devait pas boire, mais il pouvait s’as- seoir à une table et attendre, avec
      une bouteille de gin- ger ale. Après tout, n’était-il pas demeuré abstinent
      ces six derniers mois ? Peut-être même pourrait-il se per- mettre... disons
      trois verres, pas plus ! La peur s’est emparée de lui. Il marchait comme sur
      des œufs. L’an- cienne et insidieuse aberration du premier verre l’a hanté de
      nouveau. En tremblant, il s’est éloigné pour se diriger vers le répertoire des
      églises au bout du hall. Le son de la musique et des voix joyeuses flottait
      enco- re dans l’air et parvenait jusqu’à lui.\r\nMais qu’adviendrait-il de ses
      responsabilités, de sa famille et des hommes qui mourraient, faute de ne pas
      avoir su comment se rétablir ? Qu’arriverait-il de ces autres alcooliques ?
      Il devait sûrement y en avoir plu- sieurs dans cette ville. Il a décidé de téléphoner
      à un représentant de l’Église. Il a retrouvé la raison. Il a remercié Dieu.
      Choisissant une église au hasard dans le répertoire, il est entré dans une cabine
      téléphonique et a décroché le combiné.\r\nCet appel à l’ecclésiastique l’a finalement
      amené à rencontrer un certain résident de la ville qui, bien qu’ayant déjà été
      un homme compétent et respecté, était sur le point de sombrer dans l’abîme du
      déses- poir alcoolique. Son cas était classique : ménage menacé, femme malade,
      enfants anxieux, comptes en souffrance et réputation compromise. Il désirait
      ardemment cesser de boire, mais ne voyait pas com- ment y parvenir, car il avait
      déjà sérieusement tenté de s’en sortir et de plusieurs façons. Douloureusement
      conscient d’être, en quelque sorte, anormal, l’homme ne se rendait pas tout
      à fait compte de ce que signifiait être alcoolique.\r\nLorsque notre ami lui
      a raconté son expérience, l’homme a admis que, même en y mettant toute la volonté
      dont il était capable, il ne pourrait pas cesser de boire très longtemps. Une
      expérience spirituelle, il le reconnaissait, était absolument nécessaire, mais
      la charge lui en semblait lourde s’il devait se fonder sur les principes suggérés.
      Il a raconté qu’il vivait dans l’ inquiétude constante que quelqu’ un ait pu
      découvrir son alcoolisme. Et bien sûr, comme tout alcoolique, il était convaincu
      que très peu de gens connaissaient sa condition. Pourquoi, c’était là son objection,
      devrait-il perdre ce qui lui restait de clien- tèle et causer encore plus de
      souffrances à sa famille en commettant la bêtise d’avouer son état à des gens
      de qui il tirait son gagne-pain ? Il ferait n’importe quoi, disait-il, mais
      pas cela.\r\nIntrigué cependant, il a invité notre ami chez lui. Quelque temps
      après, et juste comme il croyait deve- nir maître de sa consommation d’alcool,
      il a pris une cuite magistrale. Pour lui, ce fut la crise entre toutes, la dernière.
      Il a compris que s’il voulait obtenir de Dieu la maîtrise de lui-même, il devrait
      regarder ses problèmes bien en face.\r\nUn matin, il a pris le taureau par les
      cornes, il a pris sur lui d’aller trouver les gens à qui il craignait de révéler
      ce qu’avait été son problème. Il fut étonné du bon accueil qu’il a reçu et a
      découvert que de nom- breuses personnes savaient déjà qu’il buvait. Il a fait
      en voiture la tournée de ceux à qui il avait causé du tort. Il en tremblait
      car cela risquait de ruiner quel- qu’un en particulier de son milieu professionnel.\r\nÀ
      minuit, il est rentré chez lui épuisé mais très heu- reux. Depuis, il n’a pas
      pris un verre d’alcool. Comme nous le verrons plus loin, il est désormais hautement
      considéré dans sa collectivité ; les torts importants qu’il a causés en trente
      années d’abus d’alcool ont été réparés en quatre ans.\r\nMais la vie n’a pas
      été facile pour les deux amis. Ils ont rencontré de nombreuses difficultés.
      Ensemble, ils ont compris qu’ils devaient demeurer spirituellement actifs. Un
      jour, ils ont téléphoné à l’infirmière en chef d’un hôpital de la ville. Ils
      lui ont exposé leur besoin et lui ont demandé si elle avait pour eux un alcoolique
      confirmé.\r\n« Oui, répondit-elle, nous en avons un, et c’est tout un numéro
      ! Il vient juste de rosser deux de nos infir- mières. Il perd la tête complètement
      quand il boit. Mais c’est un type épatant lorsqu’il n’a pas bu. Il a quand même
      été hospitalisé ici huit fois au cours des six der- niers mois. Je crois savoir
      qu’il était autrefois très connu comme avocat dans cette ville mais pour l’ins-
      tant, il est solidement attaché. »\r\nNous avions bien là un vrai candidat mais
      appa- remment pas trop prometteur. À l’époque, le recours aux principes spirituels
      dans des cas comme celui-ci n’était pas aussi bien compris qu’il ne l’est mainte-
      nant. Cependant l’un des deux amis a dit : « Instal- lez-le dans une chambre
      seule. Nous passerons le voir. »\r\nDeux jours plus tard, un futur membre des
      Alcooliques anonymes fixait d’un œil vitreux les deux étrangers qui se tenaient
      à côté de son lit. « Qui êtes-vous, les gars, et pourquoi une chambre seule
      ? Jusqu’à maintenant, on m’atoujoursplacédansunesallecommune. »\r\nUn des visiteurs
      a répondu : « Nous venons vous traiter pour votre alcoolisme. »\r\nLe désespoir
      se lisait en grosses lettres sur le visa- ge de l’homme lorsqu’il répliqua :
      « Oh ! mais c’est inutile ! Il n’y a rien à faire avec moi. Je suis fichu. Les
      trois dernières fois que j’ai quitté cet hôpital, je me suis soûlé avant même
      d’arriver à la maison. J’ai peur de franchir la porte. Je n’y comprends rien.
      »\r\nPendant une heure, les deux amis lui ont raconté leurs expériences d’alcooliques.
      À tout moment, le malade répétait : « C’est comme moi. C’est comme moi. Je suis
      comme ça quand je bois. »\r\nL’homme alité a appris qu’il souffrait d’une sorte
      d’empoisonnement grave, que cette affection détério- rait son organisme et lui
      dérangeait l’esprit. Il fut gran- dement question de l’état mental qui précède
      le premier verre.\r\n« Oui, c’est bien moi, disait l’homme malade. C’est tout
      à fait mon portrait. Vous savez de quoi vous par- lez, vous deux. Seulement,
      je ne vois pas à quoi cela peut servir. Vous êtes des hommes respectables. Je
      l’ai déjà été moi aussi mais maintenant, je ne suis plus rien. À vous entendre
      parler, je suis plus convaincu que jamais de mon incapacité à cesser de boire.
      » Sur ce, les deux visiteurs ont éclaté de rire. Le futur membre desAAarépliqué
      :« Jenevoispascequ’ilyade drôle là-dedans. »\r\nLes deux amis lui ont parlé
      de leur expérience spi- rituelle et de la ligne de conduite qu’ils avaient suivie.\r\nIl
      les a interrompu en disant : « J’ai été croyant et pratiquant, mais cela ne
      règle pas le problème. Les len- demains de veille, je priais Dieu et jurais
      que jamais plus je ne prendrais une goutte d’alcool, mais à neuf heures, j’étais
      soûl comme une grive. »\r\nLe lendemain, le candidat s’est montré plus récep-
      tif. Il avait réfléchi à la chose. « Vous avez peut-être raison, leur dit-il.
      Dieu doit être capable de faire n’im- porte quoi. » Puis il a ajouté : « Chose
      certaine, il n’a pas fait grand-chose pour moi quand j’essayais de lut- ter
      tout seul contre l’alcool. »\r\nLe troisième jour, l’avocat a confié sa vie
      aux soins de son Créateur et s’est dit tout à fait disposé à faire tout ce qui
      serait nécessaire. Sa femme est venue, osant à peine espérer. Elle croyait cependant
      déjà percevoir un changement chez son mari. Il avait en effet com- mencé à vivre
      une expérience spirituelle.\r\nL’après-midi même, il s’est habillé et il a quitté
      l’hô- pital en homme libre. Il s’est engagé dans une cam- pagne électorale,
      faisant des discours, fréquentant toutes sortes de lieux, restant souvent debout
      toute la nuit. Il a perdu par une faible marge seulement. Mais il avait trouvé
      Dieu et, en découvrant Dieu, il s’était trouvé lui-même.\r\nCela se passait
      en juin 1935. Depuis, il n’a plus jamais pris un verre. Lui aussi est devenu
      un membre utile et respecté de sa communauté. Il a aidé d’autres hommes à se
      rétablir et il est maintenant une force au sein de son Église qu’il avait longtemps
      négligée.\r\nIl y avait donc dans cette ville trois alcooliques qui comprennent
      aujourd’hui qu’ils doivent ou offrir à d’autres ce qu’ils ont découvert, ou
      périr. Après avoir échoué plusieurs fois dans leur recherche d’autres candidats,
      ils en ont découvert un quatrième.\r\nNous l’avons rencontré grâce à une de
      ses connais- sances qui avait entendu la bonne nouvelle. Il s’agis- sait d’un
      jeune je-m’en-foutiste dont les parents ne pouvaient pas dire si oui ou non
      il désirait cesser de boire. Son refus de tout ce qui touchait la religion ébranlait
      grandement ses parents qui étaient des gens profondément religieux. Ce jeune
      homme souffrait horriblement de ses beuveries, mais on ne pouvait apparemment
      rien pour lui. Il a toutefois consenti à entrer à l’hôpital, où il a occupé
      la même chambre qu’avait précédemment occupée l’avocat.\r\nIl a reçu trois visiteurs.
      Peu après leur arrivée il leur a dit : « Votre façon de présenter cette histoire
      d’ex- périence spirituelle a du bon sens. Je suis prêt à fran- chir le pas.
      Je crois qu’après tout, mes parents avaient raison. » C’est ainsi qu’une personne
      de plus s’est join- te à l’ Association.\r\nPendant tout ce temps, notre ami
      du hall de l’hôtel demeurait dans la ville. Il y a passé trois mois. Il est
      maintenant retourné chez lui, laissant derrière sa pre- mière rencontre, l’avocat
      et le jeune homme insouciant. Ces hommes avaient découvert quelque chose de
      tout à fait nouveau dans l’existence. Bien que conscients de l’obligation qu’ils
      avaient d’aider d’autres alcooliques s’ils voulaient demeurer abstinents, la
      motivation de l’abstinence était secondaire. Elle a été transcendée par le bonheur
      qu’ils éprouvaient à se donner pour les autres. Ils ont partagé leur foyer,
      leurs minces ressources et c’est avec joie qu’ils ont consacré leurs temps libres
      à des gens qui souffraient. De nuit comme de jour, ils n’hésitaient pas à faire
      hospitaliser un nouveau cas et à lui rendre visite par la suite. Le nombre des
      membres augmentait. Il y a eu quelques échecs bouleversants, mais dans ces cas,
      ils se sont efforcés d’amener la famille de l’alcoolique à un mode de vie spirituel,
      soula- geant ainsi grandement les proches de leur angoisse et de leur souffrance.\r\nAu
      bout d’un an et six mois, les trois pionniers avaient réussi à recruter sept
      nouveaux membres. Ils se fréquentaient beaucoup et il se passait rarement une
      soirée sans qu’il n’y ait, chez l’un ou chez l’autre, une petite réunion d’hommes
      et de femmes heureux d’être délivrés et constamment en quête d’un moyen de faire
      connaître leur découverte à quelque nouveau. En plus de se rencontrer ainsi
      sans formalité, les membres avaient pris l’habitude de réserver un soir de la
      semai- ne à une réunion destinée à quiconque était intéressé par un mode de
      vie spirituel. Le but principal de ces chaleureuses réunions à caractère social
      était aussi de fournir à de nouveaux venus une occasion et un lieu où ils pourraient
      parler de leurs problèmes.\r\nDes gens de l’extérieur sont devenus intéressés.
      Un homme et sa femme ont mis leur grande maison à la disposition de ce groupe
      drôlement assorti. Depuis, ce couple s’est tellement enthousiasmé pour notre
      œuvre qu’il a consacré sa maison au rétablissement. De nom- breuses femmes bouleversées
      y sont allées pour trou- ver la compagnie de femmes compréhensives et chaleureuses
      qui connaissaient leur problème, et pour entendre de la bouche de leurs maris
      ce qui leur était arrivé ; elles venaient chercher conseil sur les dispo- sitions
      à prendre pour qu’on hospitalise leur mari et qu’on entre en contact avec lui
      lors de sa prochaine cuite.\r\nPlus d’un homme encore ébranlé à sa sortie de
      l’hô- pital a recouvré sa liberté en franchissant le seuil de cette maison.
      Plus d’un alcoolique, après y être entré, est reparti avec une solution à son
      problème. Celui qui entrait était séduit par la gaieté qui régnait à l’intérieur,
      par ces gens qui riaient de leurs propres infortunes et comprenaient les siennes.
      Impressionné par ceux qui lui avaient rendu visite à l’hôpital, il capitulait
      entiè- rement lorsque plus tard, dans une chambre du dernier étage de la maison,
      il entendait l’histoire d’un homme dont l’expérience correspondait à la sienne.
      L’expres- sion dans les yeux des femmes, ce quelque chose d’in- définissable
      dans les yeux des hommes, l’ambiance stimulante et électrisante du milieu, tout
      concourait à le convaincre qu’il avait enfin trouvé un refuge.\r\nLa façon très
      pratique d’aborder les problèmes de chacun, l’absence de toute intolérance et
      de formalité, l’authentique démocratie, l’étonnante compréhension dont ces gens
      témoignaient étaient irrésistibles. L’al- coolique et sa femme sortaient de
      cette maison déjà emballés à la pensée de ce qu’ils pouvaient faire doré- navant
      pour aider un alcoolique de leur milieu et sa famille. Ils savaient qu’ils avaient
      une foule de nou- veaux amis ; ils avaient l’impression qu’ils connais- saient
      ces étrangers depuis toujours. Ils avaient été témoins de miracles et c’était
      chez eux que le miracle allait maintenant s’opérer. Ils avaient eu la vision
      de la Grande Réalité, de leur Créateur bon et tout-puis- sant.\r\nAujourd’hui,
      cette maison réussit à peine à accueillir tous les visiteurs hebdomadaires car
      leur nombre atteint régulièrement soixante ou quatre- vingts. Les alcooliques
      qui y sont attirés viennent de partout, de près comme de loin. Des villes envi-
      ronnantes, des familles couvrent une bonne distance pour s’y rendre en voiture.
      Une ville à quarante- huit kilomètres de là compte quinze membres chez les Alcooliques
      anonymes. Comme il s’agit d’un grand centre, nous croyons que l’Association
      devrait un jour y compter plusieurs centaines de membres*. Cependant, la vie
      des Alcooliques anonymes, c’est plus que d’assister à des réunions et de se
      rendre à l’hôpital. Réparer les pots cassés, aider les familles à régler leurs
      différends, expliquer le cas du fils déshé- rité à ses parents courroucés, prêter
      de l’argent et aider à trouver du travail en cas de besoin, cela fait partie
      de notre vie quotidienne. Jamais quelqu’un de vraiment sincère n’a été trop
      discrédité ni n’est trop déchu pour se voir refuser un accueil chaleureux. Les
      distinctions sociales, les petites rivalités et les jalou- sies, tout cela nous
      fait bien rire. Naufragés d’un même navire, puis rétablis et unifiés sous un
      même Dieu et désireux de se consacrer corps et âme au bien-être des autres,
      nos membres ne trouvent plus beaucoup d’intérêt dans les choses qui comptent
      tant pour d’autres. Comment le pourraient-ils ?\LDans des conditions qui diffèrent
      à peine, le même scénario se déroule dans plusieurs villes de l’est du pays.
      Dans l’une de ces villes se trouve un hôpital réputé pour le traitement des
      alcooliques et des dro- gués. Il y a six ans, un de nos membres y avait été
      admis. Plusieurs d’entre nous ont ressenti, pour la première fois, la présence
      et la force de Dieu à l’in- térieur des murs de cet établissement. Nous devons
      beaucoup au médecin responsable de la bonne marche de cet hôpital, car, bien
      que cela puisse contrevenir à ses propres travaux, il nous dit croire en notre
      méthode. Presque chaque jour, ce médecin suggère notre\r\ndémarche à un patient.
      Comme il comprend ce que nous faisons, il est en mesure de déceler ceux qui
      sont disposés à se rétablir sur une base spirituelle, et en mesure d’y parvenir.
      Plusieurs des nôtres, qui sont d’anciens patients de cet hôpital, y retournent
      pour offrir leur aide. Puis, dans cette même ville, des rencontres informelles
      ont lieu, comme celles décrites précédemment, où l’on peut y voir aujourd’hui
      un grand nombre de membres. On y voit naître les mêmes amitiés spontanées et
      l’on y trouve le même empressement des uns envers les autres que chez nos amis
      de l’ouest du pays. Nos membres voyagent beaucoup d’un bout à l’autre du pays
      pour apporter leur aide, et nous prévoyons une forte augmentation de ces échanges.\r\nNous
      espérons qu’un jour, tous les alcooliques qui voyagent trouveront un groupe
      des Alcooliques ano- nymes là où ils iront. Jusqu’à un certain point, cela se
      vérifie déjà, comme peuvent l’attester nos membres représentants de commerce.
      Des petits groupes de deux, trois ou cinq membres ont surgi dans certaines localités
      grâce aux communications établies avec nos deux grands centres. Ceux d’entre
      nous qui voyagent font une halte dans ces localités aussi souvent qu’ils le
      peuvent. De cette façon, nous pouvons prêter main forte à ces groupes et, du
      même coup, échapper aux tentations dont tout voyageur peut vous parler.\r\nC’est
      ainsi que nous avons grandi. Et vous aussi, vous pouvez grandir même si vous
      êtes tout seul, avec le livre comme tout bagage. Nous croyons et espérons qu’il
      contient tout ce dont vous avez besoin pour com- mencer. Nous savons ce que
      vous pensez. Vous vous dites : « Je suis seul et j’ai peur. Je suis incapable
      de faire cela. » Mais vous le pouvez. Vous oubliez que vous venez de vous brancher
      sur une force grandement supérieure à vous-même. Répéter ce que nous avons accompli,
      avec un tel appui, n’est qu’une question de bonne volonté, de patience et de
      travail.\r\nNous connaissons un membre des AA qui vivait dans une grande ville.
      Cet homme n’y était arrivé que depuis quelques semaines lorsqu’il a découvert
      que l’endroit abritait probablement plus d’alcooliques par kilomètre carré que
      n’importe quel autre dans le pays. Cela se passait quelques jours seulement
      avant que ces lignes ne soient écrites (1939). La situation causait beaucoup
      d’inquiétude aux autorités locales. Notre ami a communiqué avec un éminent psychiatre
      qui avait pris en charge la santé mentale de la popu- lation. Ce médecin était
      compétent et souhaitait ardemment appliquer toute méthode qui viendrait à bout
      de la situation. Il a donc demandé à notre ami ce qu’il avait à lui proposer.\r\nNotre
      ami a commencé à lui fournir des explications. Il a si bien réussi que le médecin
      a accepté de faire un essai auprès de ses malades et de certains autres alcoo-
      liques de la clinique où il pratiquait. On a également pris des arrangements
      avec le psychiatre en chef d’un grand hôpital public pour sélectionner d’autres
      malades parmi le flot de misérables qui fréquentaient l’établis- sement.\r\nCe
      membre des AA aura sans doute bientôt une foule d’amis. Certains, peut-être,
      sombreront et ne s’en relèveront jamais, mais si nous nous fondons sur notre
      expérience, nous pouvons affirmer que plus de la moitié des personnes pressenties
      deviendront membres des Alcooliques anonymes. Lorsque quelques alcooliques de
      cette ville auront retrouvé la santé et découvert la joie d’en aider d’autres
      à faire de nouveau face à la vie, le processus continuera jus- qu’à ce que chaque
      malade de cette ville ait eu l’oc- casion de se rétablir, à condition qu’il
      en soit capable et qu’il le veuille.\r\nPeut-être vous dites-vous encore : «
      Mais je n’au- rai pas la chance d’entrer en contact avec vous, les auteurs de
      ce livre. » Nous n’en savons rien. Il revient à Dieu d’en décider. Vous devez
      vous rappeler que c’est toujours sur Lui que vous devez vraiment vous fier.
      Il vous montrera comment créer le groupe que vous désirez tant*.\r\nNotre livre
      n’a pas d’autres intentions que de vous présenter des suggestions. Nous nous
      rendons compte que nous savons peu de choses. Dieu nous en révé- lera sans cesse
      davantage, à vous comme à nous. Dans votre méditation du matin, demandez-Lui
      ce que vous pouvez faire chaque jour pour celui qui souffre encore. La réponse
      vous sera donnée si vos propres affaires sont en ordre. Cependant, il est évi-
      dent que vous ne pouvez transmettre quelque chose que vous n’avez pas. Assurez-vous
      que vos relations avec Dieu sont bonnes et de grandes choses se pro- duiront
      pour vous et pour un nombre incalculable d’autres personnes. Pour nous, c’est
      cela, la Grande Vérité.\r\nAbandonnez-vous à Dieu tel que vous Le conce- vez.
      Reconnaissez vos fautes devant Lui et devant vos proches. Déblayez votre passé
      de ses débris.\r\nDonnez généreusement ce que vous avez découvert et joignez-vous
      à nous. Nous serons avec vous dans la Communion de l’esprit, et nul doute que
      vous croi- serez quelques-uns des nôtres lorsque, vous marche- rez courageusement
      sur le chemin de l’Heureux Destin.\r\nD’ici là, que Dieu vous garde et vous
      bénisse !\r\n"

    - My Name is Roger, and I'm An Alcoholic
    - |-
      In August 1979, I took my last drink. It was about four o'clock on a Saturday afternoon, the hot sun streaming through the windows of my little carriage house on Dickens. I put a glass of scotch and soda down on the living room table, went to bed, and pulled the blankets over my head. I couldn't take it any more.
          On Monday I went to visit wise old Dr. Jakob Schlichter. I had been seeing him for a year, telling him I thought I might be drinking too much. He agreed, and advised me to go to "A.A.A," which is what he called it. Sounded like a place where they taught you to drink and drive. I said I didn't need to go to any meetings. I would stop drinking on my own. He told me to go ahead and try, and check back with him every month.
          The problem with using will power, for me, was that it lasted only until my will persuaded me I could take another drink. At about this time I was reading The Art of Eating, by M. F. K. Fisher, who wrote: "One martini is just right. Two martinis are too many. Three martinis are never enough." The problem with making resolutions is that you're sober when you make the first one, have had a drink when you make the second one, and so on. I've also heard, You take the first drink. The second drink takes itself. That was my problem. I found it difficult, once I started, to stop after one or two. If I could, I would continue until I decided I was finished, which was usually some hours later. The next day I paid the price in hangovers.

    - Sea of Humanity
    - |-
      Let us suppose we are all connected through consciousness. There are enough philosophies and modern day scientific theories out there that suggest that we are. Assuming those are or at least might be, true, then in a very real way, the people around us are aspects of ourselves. If we are all “one mind” then it follows that everyONE is in essence, ourselves. How we treat others then becomes a reflection of how we treat ourselves. And how we treat ourselves in turn is how we are treating others.
          For example, most everyone is afraid of death, of dying. One of the ways we can soothe ourselves, altruistically, is to soothe others, to be a good friend, to be a happy face, to be a good listener. We are all in this together. Compassion is knowing this and reaching out. In so doing, we are helping ourselves as well — helping ourSELF, the whole sea of humanity.

    - Updating on a Saturday night!
    - |-
      Well, it is nearly Sunday but that is even sadder really… this used to be key party time!
          I haven’t updated for a couple of days purely because I haven’t had much to say. I didn’t manage the meeting on Thursday as I was trying to put a job application form together that had to be in by midday Friday. The truth is I want to – and will – go to another meeting soon (probably Monday) but it is because I want to go and be in a room with other members. In terms of NEEDING to, I don’t feel like that, and that is largely because I am at home. I am trying hard to get a new job and I will be happy when I get one but I will genuinely be seeing that as the REAL test of how sobriety is in my life once that happens.
          As I have said before, I find the ‘Saturday tea-time’ hard because it was always my favourite part of the evening… getting the first drinks down us, the banter with the lads, anticipating the fun night ahead. But tonight I even managed to breeze through because I had a curry :-)
          Don’t get that twisted though; I am not getting complacent about my sobriety. Here is an example – next Saturday night we are having a night out. I can barely afford it but it will be okay because I drink cordial. However, if I feel that I can not do that, then I will either not go out or if I feel like that when I am out, I will go home early. The bottom line is that I think I will be okay but, while I am pleased that thinking about drink is definitely lessening, I am ready to play very safe if need be. It will probably annoy some people, however my real mates will understand, and hell to anyone that has a problem with it.
          So that is it. Half-way through the weekend, and feeling happy. Not too shabby for KIMBO!

    - Two Months Yesterday
    - |-
      That is how long I have been sober.
          It’s been good. I haven’t been to an AA meeting in a while though so I plan on going tomorrow. I was going to go on Monday but I applied for two jobs that had closing dates of yesterday and today, so opted to delay my meeting attendance by three days. I am quite looking forward to it. But I am pleased with two months. Definitely.
          I’ve been thinking the last few days about how it’s a shame I never had a farewell session. Not that I plan on having a grand finale or anything, just thinking it’s a shame that the last time I had a drink was on my own and not amongst friends. But then most of my drinking in the last few months was on my own with headphones blasting music in my ears; just absolute escapism.
          Another anniversary is today and that is  my Dad hasn’t had a cigarette in 14 months. Which means the last day of his first year of non-smoking was my first day of sobriety… what a strange coincidence that was! I’m very proud of him. I am sure in many ways it is very similar, what he is going through. There are obvious differences, but I am sure that there are some similarities too.
          I have had no desire to drink since Friday, which is good. I went the pub for lunch yesterday and had no desire at all to have a drink. The person I met for lunch had a pint and it did not not bother me at all; in fact, if I suspect someone is not drinking on my behalf that makes me feel more awkward. I admit I do not want to be around drunk people and I can control those circumstances. However, I really have no issue with people drinking in my company, and I hope no-one ever feels like they shouldn’t drink around me.
          So, just over half-way through the week and it’s been a good week so far. It would be nice to end it with a £66m Euromillions win on Friday!

    - Is AA the Only Option? Not Anymore.
    - |-
      It always seemed strange to me that you had to go down into a church basement to get sober, especially if you are prone to depression, skeptical of religion, and/or sensitive to your environment.  But when I was younger, I thought Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) was the only way for alcoholics to get sober. My mom went, it worked for her, and I never heard about any other options. People she knew who dropped out usually relapsed, or so it seemed.
          Lately, AA has come under fire. Most notably, from Gabrielle Glaser, the author of a popular new book about women and drinking, “Her Best-Kept Secret.” She claims that AA can be an unsafe place for women, as people with multiple issues attend meetings freely (sex offenders with alcohol problems, for example).
          Now, a new study suggests that the current model of AA may be more effective for men than women. Researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital found that men tend to relapse when they’re in social situations with other drinkers. AA helps male alcoholics stay sober by offering camaraderie with other nondrinkers, and by giving them coping mechanisms for when they’re with friends who drink.

      How do you make sure your children are safe when left alone with an alcoholic or addict?
          How do you trust anything your addict or alcoholic co-parent says?
          What resources exist for helping a mom or dad out when sharing their children with an alcoholic or addict?
          What is the right thing to do when sharing children with a known liar and user?
          How do you do what’s best for the kids (maximum time with each parent, minimal observed fighting) while maintaining small children’s safety?
          These are the questions I have grappled with for nearly a year now.
          And let me tell you, there are no clear answers and there is no marked path.
          This feels like uncharted territory, with a raving lunatic as my co-pilot.
          When I crafted a legal separation document, with the help of my lawyer, I didn’t know what the hell I was doing. She wasn’t really sure either; she’s a good lawyer but not an expert in addiction matters. As I’ve found, very few are.
          I asked several counselors at our favorite rehab facility (soon-to-be-ex is a two time attendee, 0 time graduate), but they don’t like to get involved in custody matters. Off the record a counselor told me I was wise to be strict and that based on the little recovery he’d seen and what he knows of the dangerous drugs Zach was using, he wouldn’t trust him alone, either.
          I asked a court-appointed parenting expert, she wasn’t sure either, but surely the court had assigned somebody?
          No, I answered, he signed a separation agreement without getting a lawyer, we avoided the courts.
          She had no advice to give.
          So I am in this alone, making it up as I go, with only my Higher Power, my intuition, and my limited knowledge of addiction/alcoholism to get me by.

    - How I Stopped Drowning in Drink
    - |-
      For years I'd told myself I wasn't an alcoholic. I never drank alone. I didn't wake up with fierce cravings, and sometimes I went for one or two days without drinking. A need to drink all day, every day, was never my problem.
          My problem was that once I had a drink—whether it was at 7 p.m. or 9 a.m.—I couldn't stop until my body shut down and I passed out in a pile on the floor. I still had plenty of friends and still managed to hold down a job, but my relationship with alcohol was very obviously different from most people's. I was an alcoholic.
          As of Saturday, the counter on my website says "878 days." Eight hundred seventy-eight days since I had my last alcoholic drink. Eight hundred seventy-eight days since I declared—very publicly—that my drinking had passed the point where it was funny, crazy or even merely dangerous. In fact, my addiction to alcohol had reached a stage where it was highly likely to kill me.
          Enough was enough. So I decided to quit. But I didn't do it in the typical way.
          For one thing, I didn't go to Alcoholics Anonymous. Not a single meeting. I have several friends who attend AA and have found it to be a highly effective way to quit. I have plenty of other friends who attend AA meetings every morning and are blind drunk every night. I almost attended a meeting at the suggestion of a friend, but first I decided to read the organization's Twelve Steps, the program that members must follow. The first step was enough to confirm that this form of sobriety wasn't for me:
          "We admitted we were powerless over alcohol—that our lives had become unmanageable."
          Please. You may be weak against alcohol, or seriously addicted to it, but powerless? No. If a drinker were truly powerless, then AA would be useless to him; nothing short of death could stop him from drinking.

      don’t know I’m an alcoholic. I didn’t lose my good name, my husband, or even
      my driver’s license. I’m the woman next door who was fun to party with and could
      drink a 250-pound man under the table. I’ve changed the names of my friends,
      but my family, well, you’re my family and there’s no changing that. December
      27, 2002, marks the day I quit drinking. So here goes. \n    Peace,\n    Brenda

    - Reflecting on the first AA Meeting
    - |-
      I recently attended my first AA meeting. It surpassed many of my expectations; however it ruined others and left me slightly dumbfounded.
          My imagination, with the help of television and movies, painted a picture in my mind of what an AA meeting would be like. It portrayed a room filled with people that obviously looked like addicts; unkempt appearances, borderline offensive hygiene, and at least one person emitting a radiance of booze while swaying back and forth in his chair, balancing on the line between falling forward to the ground and staying in the seat.
          My imagination laughed at me as I entered the room. One look around made me realize that I was deceived. The majority of the members were clean, well kempt, and looked healthier than my medical school classmates. Skeptical, I scanned the room again for the person that showed up with a pint of liquor in his/her system. My imagination rationalized that they must have not shown up today, for certainly you can’t have an AA meeting with 100% sobriety. To say the least, I’m still discouraged by its elaborate depiction of this clean and encouraging environment.
          After walking through the threshold and soaking it all in, I found a seat near the back where I assumed the newbies were relegated to. Upon finding my spot, I was immediately welcomed by an older gentleman, John, whom was eager to invite me in and listen to my story. I explained everything that you already know about me i.e. intrinsic interest in addiction and an interest in learning from the people that have the greatest depth of knowledge and widest breath of experience in alcoholism, you.

      Yesterday was the 17th anniversary of my first A.A. meeting, which marked the beginning of my current spell of continuous sobriety. I can't say I celebrated, because I was too busy doing things that are little more than the blessings of a sober life:
          Took my car in to have the oil changed and the engine light checked—I not only have a driver's license, I also have a car
          Worked—I am employable today
          Chaired a meeting of the local chapter of a professional organization—not only employed, but on the Board of Directors and also Program Chair
          Attended a funeral
          The funeral, ironically enough, was for Bumblebee, someone I sponsored for a while. I suspect I was his last sponsor. I hadn't seem him in at least a year, and sometimes wondered if he named me when asked if he had a sponsor. Then I would wonder if he was even making meetings.
          Apparently not. He was definitely out there. He committed suicide by stabbing himself to death in the parking lot of the apartment complex where he lived. In the femoral artery. Thank you, Bumblebee, for keeping it green for me on my anniversary.
          Tonight I will celebrate with dinner and a meeting! Praise HP, from whom all blessings flow!

      You see, I stupidly and was of a stoned kinda of mind while I agreed to go to the meeting spot of an A.A. meeting with Ambiguous Andy: The kind queer fellow with 37 years of sobriety, but then out of left fucking field last week takes three different man sized Colorado hits off 3 different strains of ganja after me being back in his dwelling and life (as the only change in his), full time for a months time. In essence I am his devils details and how off my cocks rocker does it make me that I can pull it off. $200 Friday this last 18th. $25 Monday the 20th, and then $600 Tuesday the 21st at Midnight, which if technicalities are at play, it would be the 22nd. The sources range from Sober Houses to Porn Trainee.
          Anyway, even though the amounts have been outlined to the ambiguous Droid, watching his firm jawline (since its mental due to a sexy motorcycle accident in the 70′s), watch it hit the floor when he realizes what I can collect and how rapidly and steadily because I am an entrepreneur as much as I am a long-dicked opportunist, and that combination rarely leaves someone without sources of cash. They have a sweet tooth for fast action around this territory, darling, and Im the James Dean of Flaming Fiends.
          I guess no one is surprised in the fucking minimal of degrees that I never came close to even giving it a Dutchmen’s effort to make it into the AA meeting. Andrew, curse and bless his wretched dick loving soul, he was faithfully stacking chairs and loading coffee for the St. Paul group of drunks on a Sunday with the air temp at 10 degrees, reciting like Pole Pot, preparing the upside down crucifixion of my lifespan just shy of three decades. I really am not or was not cut out for this absolute anything monologue , let alone sobriety. What a waste of potential life adventure, and selling yourself short.

    - Sober, But Still A Perfectionist
    - |-
      Today is my first anniversary of sobriety, and I am extremely grateful to the fellowship of A.A. as I owe this almost entirely to them (with a huge pinch of support and encouragement from my wife).  I stopped blogging when I officially got a sponsor and was taken through the big book.  I’m sure I caused my sponsor a lot of pain, as I questioned almost everything, but I have to reach out and thank him from the bottom of my heart.  I have a slight regret that I stopped sharing my recovery, but during this period I can only summarise it as feeling a bit like a sailor being rescued at sea.  I was lost, desolate and struggling to make sense of my emotions, the book and what to do and it was only through sponsorship that the simple 12 step programme took hold.
          It turns out that I have a few flaws in my character – I’m a manipulative, lying control freak, with a huge ego, low self-esteem and just a hint of perfectionism (did I mention anger issues?).  Even this article is perfectionism at play since it has been in the back of mind for several weeks now.  But, I’m sober and haven’t touched a drink for one year, and that is truly a miracle…
          I don’t have a sponsor any more, but I’m extremely comfortable with this as I feel I have a community of friends, any of whom I could turn to in despair, and I have a wife who still stands by and supports me, which is amazing given the turmoil and emotional roller-coaster I have subjected her to.  The sponsor who took me through the book had an exceptional message and I truly hope that our decision to part ways was not selfish on my part, or a subtle manifestation of the disease.  I believe this is step 12 as willed by my higher power; allowing a great sponsor to work with another suffering alcoholic feels right, alongside my continued service to my local home groups and now returning to update this journal.  At some point I may work with another alcoholic, but for the moment I am grateful that I can make amends to my family on a daily basis and can retire at night grateful for the simple things in life that eluded me in the past.
